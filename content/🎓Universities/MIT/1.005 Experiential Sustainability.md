<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines the frameworks, governance, science, and social science of sustainability around students' summer internships, research, and other experiential learning activities. During the summer (virtually) and through the first four weeks of the fall term, students engage in small group discussions on diverse topics in sustainability, from environmental justice to corporate social responsibility. Includes global climate action negotiation simulation activities, roundtables with experts in sustainability, and/or similar opportunities for interaction with broad topics in sustainability. In the fall, students reflect on their engagement with sustainability during their summer experience, culminating in a showcase of final presentations. Students planning to take this subject must apply in the spring; consult the program website for details.</font>
