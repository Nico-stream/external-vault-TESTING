<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces probability with an emphasis on probabilistic systems analysis. Readings about conceptual and mathematical background are given in advanced of each class. Classes revise background and are centered on developing problem-solving skills. The course is exam-based and focused on the analysis of probabilistic outcomes, estimating what can happen under uncertain environments. Topics include random events and their probability, combinatorial analysis, conditional analysis, random vectors, functions of random vectors, propagation of uncertainty, and prediction analysis. Credit cannot also be received for 1.010.</font>
