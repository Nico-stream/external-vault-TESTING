<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces causal inference with an emphasis on probabilistic systems analysis. Readings about conceptual and mathematical background are given in advanced of each class. Class is focused on understanding theory based on real-world applications. The course is project-based and focused on cause-effect relationships, understanding why probabilistic outcomes happen. Topics include correlation analysis, Reichenbach's principle, Simpson's paradox, structural causal models and graphs, interventions, do-calculus, average causal effects, dealing with missing information, mediation, and hypothesis testing. Credit cannot also be received for 1.010.</font>
