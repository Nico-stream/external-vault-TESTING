<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Design, construction, and testing of field robotic systems, through team projects with each student responsible for a specific subsystem. Projects focus on electronics, instrumentation, and machine elements. Design for operation in uncertain conditions is a focus point, with ocean waves and marine structures as a central theme. Basic statistics, linear systems, Fourier transforms, random processes, spectra and extreme events with applications in design. Lectures on ethics in engineering practice included. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication provided. Satisfies 6 units of Institute Laboratory credit. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity.</font>
