<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Working in small teams with real clients, students develop solutions related to the year's Terrascope topic.Â They have significant autonomy as they follow a full engineering design cycle from client profile through increasingly sophisticated prototypes to final product. Provides opportunities to acquire skills with power tools, workshop practice, design, product testing, and teamwork. Focuses on sustainability and appropriate technology that matches the client's specific situation and constraints. Products are exhibited in the public Bazaar of Ideas and evaluated by an expert panel. Class taught in collaboration with D-Lab and Beaver Works. Limited to first-year students. Open to students outside of Terrascope.</font>
