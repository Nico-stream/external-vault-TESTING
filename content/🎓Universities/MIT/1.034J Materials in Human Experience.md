<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines how people throughout history have selected, evaluated, processed, and utilized natural materials to create objects of material culture. Explores ideological and aesthetic criteria influential in materials development. As examples of ancient engineering and materials processing, topics may include ancient Roman concrete and prehistoric iron and steel production by the Mossi, Haya, and other African cultures. Particular attention paid to the climate issues surrounding iron and cement, and how the examination of ancient technologies can inform our understanding of sustainability in the present and illuminate paths for the future. Previous topics have included Maya use of lime plaster for frescoes, books, and architectural sculpture; the sound, color, and power of metals in Mesoamerica; and metal, cloth, and fiber technologies in the Inca empire. Laboratory sessions provide practical experience with materials discussed in class. Enrollment limited to 24.</font>
