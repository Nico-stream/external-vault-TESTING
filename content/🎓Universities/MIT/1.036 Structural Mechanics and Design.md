<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Familiarizes students with structural systems, loads, and basis for structural design, including analysis of determinate and indeterminate structures (trusses, beams, frames, cables, and arches). Covers mechanical properties of construction materials, including concrete, steel, and composites. Studies concrete and steel structures through application of principles of structural mechanics. Evaluates behavior and design of reinforced concrete structural elements using limit strength design and serviceability principles. Introduces plastic analysis and design, and load factor design of structural steel members and connections. Team project emphasizes material covered through behavior and problem-based learning.</font>
