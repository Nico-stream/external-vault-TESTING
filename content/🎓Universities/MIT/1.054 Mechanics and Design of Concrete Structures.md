<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Studies strength and deformation of concrete under various states of stress; failure criteria; concrete plasticity; and fracture mechanics concepts. Topics include fundamental behavior of reinforced concrete structural systems and their members; basis for design and code constraints; high-performance concrete materials and their use in innovative design solutions; and yield line theory for slabs. Uses behavior models and nonlinear analysis. Covers complex systems, including bridge structures, concrete shells, and containments. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
