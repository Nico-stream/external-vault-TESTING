<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to environmental chemistry, focusing on the fate of chemicals in both natural and engineered systems. Covers equilibrium reactions (e.g., partitioning, dissolution/precipitation, acid-base, redox, metal complexation), and kinetically-controlled reactions (e.g., photolysis, free radical oxidation). Specific environmental topics covered include heavy metals in natural waters, drinking water, and soils; biogeochemical cycles; radioactivity in the environment; smog formation; greenhouse gases and climate change; and engineering for the prevention and remediation of pollution. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
