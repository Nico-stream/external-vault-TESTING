<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the creative design process in the context of civil and environmental engineering. Emphasizes the idea-to-product trajectory: identification of a design question/problem, evaluation of requirements/constraints set by the application and/or client, and implementation into a concrete product deliverable.  Fosters active learning through open-ended, student-driven projects in which teams apply the design process to a design/planning problem. In labs, students design and build a working model or an experiment that addresses a specific engineering aspect of their project. In addition to written and oral presentations, students start a web-based portfolio. Satisfies 6 units of Institute Laboratory credit. Enrollment limited; preference to Course 1 majors and minors.</font>
