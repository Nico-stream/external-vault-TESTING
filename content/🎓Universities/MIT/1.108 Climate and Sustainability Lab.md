<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Students work together on a project addressing climate mitigation and/or adaptation. The topic of the project changes from year to year but builds on the knowledge and skills gained in previous coursework in climate science and engineering. Students are challenged to demonstrate creativity in applying theories and methodologies while considering their project's technical, social, and theoretical feasibility. Includes lectures on related climate-change scientific and engineering concepts. Provides instruction and practice in oral and written communication.</font>
