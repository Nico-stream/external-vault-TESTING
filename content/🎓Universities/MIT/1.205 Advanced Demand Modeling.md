<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Advanced theories and applications of models for analysis and forecasting of users' behavior and demand for facilities, services, and products. Topics vary each year and typically include linear and nonlinear latent variable models, including structural equations and latent class models; estimation techniques with multiple data sources; joint discrete and continuous choice models; dynamic models; analysis of panel data; analysis of complex choices; estimation and forecasting with large choice sets; multidimensional probabilistic choice models; advanced choice models, including probit, logit mixtures, treatment of endogeneity, hybrid choice models, hidden Markov models, Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian methods, survey design, sampling, model transferability,Â use of stated preferences data, and discrete choice models with machine learning. Term paper required.</font>
