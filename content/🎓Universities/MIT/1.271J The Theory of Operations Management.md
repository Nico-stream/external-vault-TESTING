<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides mathematical foundations underlying the theory of operations management. Covers both classic and state-of-the-art results in various application domains, including inventory management, supply chain management and logistics, behavioral operations, healthcare management, service industries, pricing and revenue management, and auctions. Studies a wide range of mathematical and analytical techniques, such as dynamic programming, stochastic orders, principal-agent models and contract design, behavioral and experimental economics, algorithms and approximations, data-driven and learning models, and mechanism design. Also provides practical experience in how to apply the theoretical models to solve OM problems in business settings. Specific topics vary from year to year.</font>
