<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces theoretical and experimental aspects of rock mechanics and prepares students for rock engineering.  Includes review of laboratory and field testing; empirical and analytical methods for describing strength, deformability and conductivity of intact rock and rock masses; fracture mechanics and mechanics of discontinua, including flow through discontinua and hydraulic fracturing; and design and analysis of rock slopes and foundations on rock. Also discusses blasting design.  Includes term paper/term project.</font>
