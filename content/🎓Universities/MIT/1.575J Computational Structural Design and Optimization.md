<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Research seminar focusing on emerging applications of computation for creative, early-stage structural design and optimization for architecture. Incorporates computational design fundamentals, including problem parameterization and formulation; design space exploration strategies, including interactive, heuristic, and gradient-based optimization; and computational structural analysis methods, including the finite element method, graphic statics, and approximation techniques. Programing experience and familiarity with structural mechanics necessary.Â Additional work required of students taking graduate version. Limited to 25 total for versions meeting together.</font>
