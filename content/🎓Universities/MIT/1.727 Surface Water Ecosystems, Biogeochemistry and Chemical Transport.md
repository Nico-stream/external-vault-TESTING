<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Addresses the nature of lakes, wetlands, and related natural waters, with a focus on their ecology and cycling of nutrients and pollutants. Topics include the hydrology of surface water systems, the nature of aquatic plant and animal communities, the carbon and nitrogen cycles, the behavior and fate of toxic metals and anthropogenic organic compounds in natural waters, and linkages between lakes and the atmosphere, groundwater, and soil. Discusses practical topics in lake and river management. Students participate in field trips to broaden their understanding of these topics.</font>
