<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Graduate students mentor an undergraduate student in research for 30 hours per week during the Independent Activities Period (IAP) to help create a self-contained project. Students introduce the project through selected readings and meetings that clearly explain how the undergraduate project fits within the scope of the larger work/research of the graduate student, meet regularly to discuss progress on the project, provide guidance in the creation of a poster presentation that the undergraduate will deliver at the end of IAP, and attend and provide written feedback on the presentations of all mini-UROP participants.</font>
