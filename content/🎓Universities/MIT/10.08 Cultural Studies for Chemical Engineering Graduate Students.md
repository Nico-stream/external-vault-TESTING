<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Seminar explores some of the key cultural developments of human beings and their related engineering aspects together with insights into the evolution of chemical engineering. Begins with discussion of Warren K. Lewis on culture and civilization, in addition to other chemical engineering luminaries, Rutherford Aris and John Prausnitz, and Sam Florman. Following their leads, seminar addresses key developments in Greek culture, followed by Renaissance culture, and culminating with contemporary culture. Discusses the influence of chemical engineering throughout the term, but focuses on broader cultural understanding as advocated by Lewis and Aris. Weekly meetings and study question responses are complemented with direct experience of culture and its connection to engineering. Includes guests with various expertise in culture and chemical engineering.</font>
