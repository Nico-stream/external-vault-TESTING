<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores the significance and applicability of models of molecular systems, starting from modern modeling and going back to ancient possibilities. Newtonian mechanics and optics to thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, simulations, and machine learning are covered together with foundational modern and ancient concepts of modeling. Addresses the questions of what models of molecular systems aim towards, what makes a good model, and how one should think about model robustness from phenomenological to first-principles models and from concrete to abstract. Foundational readings inform current approaches, applications including biology, optics and vision, and atomic science. Work consists of weekly assignments, class participation, and a final project.</font>
