<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Presents engineering principles and unit operations involved in the manufacture of small molecules pharmaceuticals, from the isolation of purified active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) to the final production of drug product. Regulatory issues include quality by design and process analytical technologies of unit operations, such as crystallization, filtration, drying, milling, blending, granulation, tableting and coating. Also covers principles of formulation for solid dosage forms and parenteral drugs. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Limited to 50.</font>
