<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Addresses both the theory and application of first-principles computer simulations methods (i.e., quantum, chemical, or electronic structure), including Hartree-Fock theory, density functional theory, and correlated wavefunction methods. Covers enhanced sampling, ab initio molecular dynamics, and transition-path-finding approaches as well as errors and accuracy in total and free energies. Discusses applications such as the study and prediction of properties of chemical systems, including heterogeneous, molecular, and biological catalysts (enzymes), and physical properties of materials. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Limited to 35; no listeners.</font>
