<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores the interactions of chemical engineering, biochemical engineering, and microbiology with particular emphasis on applications to bioprocess development. Examines mathematical representations of microbial systems, especially with regard to the kinetics of growth, death, and metabolism. Discusses the fundamentals of bioreactor design and operation, including continuous fermentation, mass transfer, and agitation. Examples encompass both enzyme and whole cell systems. Presents concepts in process development for microbial and animal cell cultures, with considerations towards production of biological products ranging from chiral specialty chemicals/pharmaceuticals to therapeutic proteins. Concludes with a discussion of aspects of cellular engineering and the role of molecular biology in addressing process development problems.</font>
