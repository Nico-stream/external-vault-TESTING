<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores topics in the design and implementation of heterogeneous catalysts for chemical transformations. Emphasizes use of catalysis for environmentally benign and sustainable chemical processes. Lectures address concepts in catalyst preparation, catalyst characterization, quantum chemical calculations, and microkinetic analysis of catalytic processes. Shows how experimental and theoretical approaches can illustrate important reactive intermediates and transition states involved in chemical reaction pathways, and uses that information to help identify possible new catalysts that may facilitate reactions of interest. Draws examples from current relevant topics in catalysis. Includes a group project in which students investigate a specific topic in greater depth. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
