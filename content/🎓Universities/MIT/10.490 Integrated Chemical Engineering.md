<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Presents and solves chemical engineering problems in an industrial context. Emphasis on the integration of fundamental concepts with approaches in process design, and on problems that demand synthesis, economic analysis, and process design; consideration of safety analysis, process dynamics and the use of process simulators and related tools to approach such problems. The specific application of these fundamental concepts will vary each term, and may include chemical, electrochemical, pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical (biologic) or related processes, operated in batch, semi-batch, continuous or hybrid mode. May be repeated once for credit with permission of instructor.</font>
