<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides theoretical background to analyze and synthesize the most up-to-date findings from both laboratory and clinical investigations into solid tumor pathophysiology. Covers different topics centered on the critical role that the tumor microenvironment plays in the growth, invasion, metastasis and treatment of solid tumors. Develops a systems-level, quantitative understanding of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, metastatic process, delivery of drugs and immune cells, and response to conventional and novel therapies, including immunotherapies. Discussions provide critical comments on the challenges and the future opportunities in research on cancer and in establishment of novel therapeutic approaches and biomarkers to guide treatment.</font>
