<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Teaches both soft and hard skills to foster student success through one-month team projects, as part of the Master of Science in Chemical Engineering Practice (M.S.CEP) program. The same skills are expected to be valuable for problem-solving in both academic and industrial settings at large. Themes to be covered include career development, project management, leadership, project economics, techniques for problem solving, literature search, safety, professional behavior, and time management. Students participate in activities and discussions during class time, study preparatory and review materials on MITx and complete active-learning assessments between meetings, and complete a quiz at the end of the course. Enrollment will be limited to students in the School of Chemical Engineering Practice.</font>
