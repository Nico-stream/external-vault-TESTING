<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the basic tools needed for data analysis and interpretation in the Geosciences, as well as other sciences. Composed of four modules, targeted at introducing students to the basic concepts and applications in each module. MatLab: Principles and practice in its uses, script and function modules, basic approaches to solving problems. Statistics: Correlation, means, dispersion, precision, accuracy, distributions, central limit theorem, skewness, probability, Chi-Square, Gaussian and other common distributions used in hypothesis testing. Regression: Random and grid search methods, basic least squares and algorithms applicable to regression, inversion and parameter estimation. Signal Processing: Analog and digital signals, Z-transform, Fourier series, fast Fourier transforms, spectral analysis leakage and bias, digital filtering. Students taking the graduate version complete different assignments.</font>
