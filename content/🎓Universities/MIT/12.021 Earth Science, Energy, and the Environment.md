<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides understanding of the Earth System most relevant to production of our planet's natural energy resources, including the physics, chemistry, and biology of conventional and alternative energy sources. Includes a broad overview of traditional and alternative energy sources: hydrocarbons (conventional and unconventional), nuclear, geothermal, hydroelectric, and wind and tides, along with their potentials and limitations. Develops detailed knowledge of the formation, concentration, and production of fossil and nuclear fuels, as well as the waste products associated with their consumption. An examination of conventional and alternative energy sources includes the environmental issues associated with the exploitation of these resources, both regional and global.</font>
