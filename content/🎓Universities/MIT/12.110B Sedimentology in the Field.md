<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines the fundamentals of sedimentary deposits and geological reasoning through first hand fieldwork. Students practice methods of modern geological field study off-campus during a required trip over spring break making field observations, measuring stratigraphic sections and making a sedimentological map. Relevant topics introduced are map and figure making in ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator and sedimentary petrology. Culminates in an oral and written report built around data gathered in the field. Field sites and intervals of geologic time studied rotate annually and include Precambrian, Phanerozoic and Modern depositional environments. Satisfies 6 units of Institute Laboratory credit. May be taken multiple times for credit. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
