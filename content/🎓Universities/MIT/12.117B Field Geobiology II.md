<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Teaches fundamentals of field observations and reasoning in geobiology/sedimentology during a required trip to a modern sedimentary environment over spring break, followed by laboratory analyses of collected samples. Students make observations, develop hypotheses, collect samples required to test their hypotheses and interact with lecturers and students investigating the sedimentology of the site. Upon return to MIT, students work on field samples to characterize the sediments, use the preliminary data to develop an understanding of the field site, and write research reports. Students taking graduate version write proposals that present a research question based on the field observations and subsequent analyses. Meets with 12.110B and 12.465B when those subjects examine modern sedimentary environments.</font>
