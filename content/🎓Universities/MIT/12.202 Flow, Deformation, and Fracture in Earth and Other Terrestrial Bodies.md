<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers fundamentals of deformation and fracture of solids and the flow of viscous fluids. Explores spatial scales from molecular to planetary, and time scales from fractions of a second to millions of years, to understand how and why natural materials on Earth and other terrestrial bodies respond to applied forces. Fundamental concepts include the principles of continuum mechanics, tensor representation of physical properties, forces, tractions, stresses, strain theory, elasticity, contact problems, fracture and friction, and viscous flow and rheological models (plasticity, viscosity, viscoelasticity, elasto-plasticity). Students gather, analyze and interpret data using existing theoretical models. Includes a significant laboratory component that provides practical experience with experimental measurements and tests students' acquired theoretical knowledge. Students taking graduate version complete different assignments.</font>
