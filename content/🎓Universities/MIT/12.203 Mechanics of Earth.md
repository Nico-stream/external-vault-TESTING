<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers topics in the deformation and fracture of solids and the flow of viscous fluids. Explores spatial scales from molecular to planetary, and time scales from fractions of a second to millions of years, to understand how and why natural materials on Earth and other terrestrial bodies respond to applied forces. Introduces anelasticity, granular mechanics, poroelasticity, rate-and-state friction, transport properties of Earth materials (Darcy's law, Fick's law), brittle-ductile transitions, creep of polycrystalline materials, stored energy and dissipation, and convection. Prepares students to gather, analyze and interpret data using existing theoretical models. Through a significant laboratory component, students obtain practical experience with experimental measurements and test their acquired theoretical knowledge. Students taking graduate version complete different assignments.</font>
