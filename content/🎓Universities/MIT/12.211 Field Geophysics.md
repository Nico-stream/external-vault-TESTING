<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers practical methods of modern geophysics, including the global positioning system (GPS), gravity, and magnetics. Field work is conducted in western US and includes intensive 10-day field exercise. Focuses on measurement techniques and their interpretation. Introduces the science of gravity, magnetics, and the GPS. Measures crustal structure, fault motions, tectonic deformations, and the local gravity and magnetic fields. Students perform high-precision measurements and participate in data analysis. Emphasizes principles of geophysical data collection and the relevance of these data for tectonic faulting, crustal structure, and the dynamics of the earthquake cycle. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
