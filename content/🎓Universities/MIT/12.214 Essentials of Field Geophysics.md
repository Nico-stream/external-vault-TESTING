<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces students to the practical field application of various geophysical methods to studying Earth's near-surface and prepares students to undertake fieldwork that uses these methods. Methods covered include but are not limited to measuring seismic waves, gravity, precise positions (commonly referred to as GPS but formally known as GNSS), and topography using drones. Lab time involves local fieldwork to gain experience with the methods being taught. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
