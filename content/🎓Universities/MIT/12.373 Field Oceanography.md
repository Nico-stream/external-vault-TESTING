<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides an introduction to the biogeochemistry of the ocean, and the field techniques and methods used in its study. Emphasizes biogeochemistry and the interrelated nature of elemental cycling, but also examines physical transport and air-sea gas exchange. Covers multiple aspects related to field instrumentation and measurements, including nutrients, oxygen, the carbon system, temperature, and salinity. Presents microbial analyses, such as metagenomics. Includes a mandatory spring break field trip aboard a research vessel; opportunities for funded travel available. Students work in groups to propose a project over the week-long voyage that utilizes the field time to collect samples. During the second half of the term, students analyze and synthesize the data, and present it in a publication-quality manuscript. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Enrollment limited.</font>
