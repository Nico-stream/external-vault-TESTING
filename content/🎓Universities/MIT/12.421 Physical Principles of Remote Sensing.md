<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to the physics of remote sensing with applications to the study of the Earth, Moon, planets and other solar system bodies, as well as to emerging fields, such as autonomous navigation. Includes the principles of optical, thermal, radar and lidar remote sensing. Covers fundamental properties of electromagnetic waves; principles of electromagnetic scattering from real and idealized materials, including various types of surfaces and vegetation; interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the atmosphere; and thermal and microwave emission from various media. Discusses past, present, and future remote sensing platforms along with the fundamentals of orbital mechanics and data processing tools and methods. Assignments require students to write simple computer programs and plot mathematical functions. Students taking graduate version complete different assignments.</font>
