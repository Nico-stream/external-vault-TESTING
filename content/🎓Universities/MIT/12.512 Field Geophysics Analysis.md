<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on in-depth data analysis and development of skills needed to report results both in writing and orally. Students use data collected in 12.511 to develop written and oral reports of the results, with each student focusing on a different area. For example, students can develop the geophysical modeling or synthesis of the results into other studies in the area. The final written and oral reports are combined into a comprehensive report and presentation of the field camp and its results. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
