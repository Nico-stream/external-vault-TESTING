<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides a high level survey of a broad range of active science topics in Geological Oceanography. Presents background material that graduate students are expected to know in the disciplines of solid-earth geophysics, geochemistry, sedimentology and stratigraphy, coastal processes, and climate, including a representative set of canonical science papers, and builds on this material to give a sense of the current state of the science in these fields. Broad topics include the formation of the earth, petrogenesis, volcanism, plate tectonics, geodynamics, sedimentation in the oceans, coastal morphodynamics, paleo-oceanography, and climate. The interconnectedness of and feedbacks between processes discussed under these various topics is emphasized.</font>
