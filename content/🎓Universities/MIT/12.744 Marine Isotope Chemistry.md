<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Fundamentals of using isotopes to study processes and timescales for marine chemistry and geochemistry. Provides basic introduction to the nature, origins, and reasons for the distributions of isotopes in nature, then develops theory and approaches for radioactive dating methods. These are used to constrain the timing and nature of the geochemical evolution of the elements, solar system, earth, ocean, and atmosphere. Covers cosmogenic isotopes and their applications. Briefly discusses basics of mass spectrometry, followed by a closer inspection of the principles and applications of isotope fractionation. Introduces mass independent fractionation and clumped isotope methods. Explores applications of isotope methods to a number of water column processes, including particle scavenging, sedimentation, long term element budgets, redox processes, and air-sea exchange. Emphasizes quantitative methods and problem-solving. Includes problem sessions with development of problem solutions.</font>
