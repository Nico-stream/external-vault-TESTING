<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers basic concepts of wave motion, flow instability, and turbulence in rotating and stratified fluids with emphasis on small scales. Presents wave properties, including the dispersion relation, phase and group velocities, and wave kinematics, and uses these concepts to study the dynamics of surface and internal gravity waves, Poincare waves, Kelvin waves, and topographic waves. Includes flow instability. Explores general concepts of linear instability in small-scale stratified shear flows (Rayleigh and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities); examines non-rotating stratified turbulence resulting from these instabilities. Also discusses wave-mean flow interaction, hydraulic control, the entrainment assumption, and the interpretation of microstructure observations.</font>
