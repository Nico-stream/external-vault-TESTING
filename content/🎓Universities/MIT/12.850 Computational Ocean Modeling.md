<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Numerical modeling in oceanography and environmental fluid mechanics. Focuses on the building of computational models that describe processes such as transport (advection, diffusion), reaction (ecosystems), and boundary forcing, of relevance in the ocean. Models are developed in a hierarchical manner, starting from the simple (zero-dimensional in space), and incrementally advancing toward more complex, time-evolving systems in one-, two- (shallow water) and three-dimensions (Primitive equations). Students build their own models using the finite volume approach with an appreciation and understanding of the working of general circulation models</font>
