<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Continuation of 14.271. Focuses on government interventions in monopoly and oligopoly markets, and addresses both competition and regulatory policy. Topics include horizontal merger policy and demand estimation, vertical integration and vertical restraints, and the theory and practice of economic regulation. Applications include the political economy of regulation; the performance of economic regulation; deregulation in sectors including electric power, transportation, and financial services; and pharmaceutical and environmental regulation in imperfectly competitive product markets.</font>
