<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers a variety ofÂ topics, both theoretical and empirical, in international trade, international macroeconomics, and economic geography. Focuses on general equilibrium analysis in neoclassical economies. Considers why countries and regions trade, and what goods they trade; impediments to trade, and why some countries deliberately erect policy to impede; and implications of openness for growth. Also tackles normative issues, such as whether trade openness is beneficial, whether there are winners and losers from trade and, if so, how they can possibly be identified.</font>
