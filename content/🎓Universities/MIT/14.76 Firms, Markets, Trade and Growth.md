<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines how industrial development and international trade have brought about rapid growth and large-scale reductions in poverty for some developing countries, while globalization has simply increased inequality and brought little growth for others. Also considers why, in yet other developing countries, firms remain small-scale and have not integrated with global supply chains. Draws on both theoretical models and empirical evidence to better understand the reasons for these very different experiences and implications for policy. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
