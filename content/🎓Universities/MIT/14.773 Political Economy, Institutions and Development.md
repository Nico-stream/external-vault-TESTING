<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Economists and policymakers increasingly realize the importance of political institutions in shaping economic performance, especially in the context of understanding economic development. Work on the determinants of economic policies and institutions is in its infancy, but is growing rapidly. Subject provides an introduction to this area. Topics covered: the economic role of institutions; the effects of social conflict and class conflict on economic development; political economic determinants of macro policies; political development; theories of income distribution and distributional conflict; the efficiency effects of distributional conflict; the causes and consequences of corruption; the role of colonial history; and others. Both theoretical and empirical approaches discussed. Subject can be taken either as part of the Development Economics or the Positive Political Economy fields.</font>
