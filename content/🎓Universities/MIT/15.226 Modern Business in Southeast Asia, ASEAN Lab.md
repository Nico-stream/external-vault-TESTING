<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides integrated approach to analyze the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region — specifically Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia — through action learning. Covers modern history, economics, and politics in that region that shape the business environment, cases of companies operating in that region, and project-related issues and personal and learning reflections. Students work in teams to tackle a real world business problem with an entrepreneurial Indian ASEAN-based company and produce a final deliverable for the host company. Projects focus on dynamic sectors such as artificial intelligence, the sharing economy, social media, health care, energy, and manufacturing; examples include creating a business plan for fundraising, developing a new market strategy, and assembling financial models. Limited to graduate students who participate in ASEAN Lab.</font>
