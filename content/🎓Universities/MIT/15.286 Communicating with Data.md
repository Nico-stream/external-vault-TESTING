<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on structuring the oral and visual communication of data. Introduces these concepts and a methodology of self-reflection to help one accelerate his or her life-long learning process. Improves students' ability to develop strategic communications that use data to persuade others to take action. Primary focus is on reducing barriers to action by making data as easy as possible for others to absorb through clear structure, clear design, and clear delivery. Significant time will be devoted to practice. Students give and receive substantial feedback on their work.</font>
