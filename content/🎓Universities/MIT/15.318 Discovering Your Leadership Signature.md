<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides the tools to better understand an individual's unique way of leading, i.e., one's leadership signature. Involves intensive self-assessment and interactive exercises aimed to identify the leadership patterns that help and hinder one's ability to make change happen. Focuses on identifying core leadership strengths and weaknesses, immunity to change, and developing one's leadership signature. Explores alternative leadership approaches in order to determine capabilities to emulate and plan changes in behavior moving forward. Readings from psychology, family systems, developmental psychology, and leadership literature augment analyses.</font>
