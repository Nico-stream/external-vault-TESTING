<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Experiential study of the organizational change process within the larger context of the community in which the organization resides. Exposes students to leadership exemplars in the for-profit, nonprofit, and public sectors. Examines cases of complex social dynamics in areas of housing, employment, credit, education, and criminal justice. Centers around a semester-long action learning project in which students assist a local nonprofit organization in achieving sustainable social justice objectives. Through a project identified with the nonprofit leaders, students apply their knowledge of systems and their practice of leadership to recommend an operational change that advances the mission of the organization.</font>
