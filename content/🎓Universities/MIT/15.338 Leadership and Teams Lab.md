<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Required subject spanning the Sloan Fellows summer term. Introduces foundational leadership frameworks by weaving theory, assignments, living cases, and one-one-one and team coaching together. Building on the observation that conflict is the feedstock of innovation for both teams and organizations, frames the core challenge of leadership as leveraging the benefits of competing perspectives without falling prey to the negative interpersonal dynamics that such differences can catalyze. Offers several tools to develop increased self-awareness and emotional self-regulation to constructively uncover conflict and leverage diversity. Employs a variety of learning modalities, including experiential learning, executive coaching, and facilitated team reflections. Restricted to Sloan Fellow MBA students.</font>
