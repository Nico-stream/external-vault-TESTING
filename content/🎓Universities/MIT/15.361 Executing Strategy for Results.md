<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides students an alternative to the mechanistic view of strategy execution that reframes an organization as a complex network of teams continuously adjusting to market conditions and to other teams. Introduces the Flexible Execution Model, consisting of seven elements; strategy for execution, shared context, goals 2.0, resource re-allocation, distributed leaders, top leaders, and execution culture that together shape how well an organization executes its strategy. Discusses a set of practical tools, based on research and field-tested, that help leaders achieve their organizations' strategic priorities. Explores novel ways to use data including surveys, Glassdoor reviews, and other sources to measure strategy execution and identify what is and is not working. Preference given to Master of Business Administration students.</font>
