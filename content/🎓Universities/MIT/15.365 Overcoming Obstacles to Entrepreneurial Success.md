<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Identifying, understanding, and coping with the key problems from founding a firm throughout its full life cycle to success. Each week a successful MIT-alum entrepreneur forwards a brief on their major issue that had to be overcome. Guest speakers include prominent entrepreneurial role models. Student teams propose solutions for class discussion followed by the speaker's response and what they actually did and why. The speaker then relates the rest of the firm's development up to the present. Class begins with the research on the day's focus and ends with student teams creating one-page take-aways. Delta v, MIT Fuse, MIT 100K Finals, Sandbox or the EMBA Program are also accepted prereqs. Exemplifies the preferred dual-track entrepreneurial education, integrating academic research and practitioner experience.</font>
