<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Develops the skills required to think and lead in complex, ambiguous, multi-dimensional situations. Senior leaders from a wide variety of organizations, both public and private, profit and non-profit, large and small, discuss complex real-life situations. Students are frequently asked to take a position about how they might approach each situation, perhaps using management frameworks they have studied previously. Executives then discuss what they did, or are doing, and reflect on their own journeys as enterprise-level leaders. Assignments ask students to reflect on how they have and will show up as leaders in a variety of contexts. Restricted to Sloan graduate students. No listeners or guests.</font>
