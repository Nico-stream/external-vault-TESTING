<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to corporate finance. Classroom portion primarily uses case studies to introduce financial analytical tools needed to make real-world value-enhancing business decisions across many industries: how to decide which projects to invest in, how to finance those investments, and how to manage the cash flows of the firm. Laboratory sessions are organized around team valuation projects, such as valuation of an oil field and analysis of a potential merger between two public firms proposed by student teams. Projects require extensive use of financial databases. Laboratory sessions also provide instruction on writing and speaking on financial topics. Meets with 15.402 when offered concurrently.</font>
