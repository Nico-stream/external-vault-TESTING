<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on investment decisions in the presence of noisy market prices. Exposes students to the role of informational arbitrage, whereby some agents invest resources to become informed about mispricing (i.e., noise) relative to fundamental values, with hopes of profiting from it. Explains the practice of active investing, the relation between information flows and market pricing dynamics, and the roles of retail investors. Topics included derive from financial economics: market efficiency, cognitive constraints, limits to arbitrage, quantitative stock selection; and accounting-based research: equity valuation, fundamental analysis, and the role of financial analysts.</font>
