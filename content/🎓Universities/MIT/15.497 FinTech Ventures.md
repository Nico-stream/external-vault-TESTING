<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Designed for entrepreneurial types interested in the FinTech space, this course presents a unique opportunity to work through the nuts and bolts of developing, investing in or acquiring a FinTech startup. Bring your idea and/or team, or find both at class and develop your plan for the final "Demo Day" in front of a group of investors. In each class a new speaker (entrepreneurs, legal experts, venture capitalists) is welcomed who addresses relevant topics, while students present progress reports and receive advice and feedback. Students with an interest in being part of a FinTech startup, regardless of background (legal, financial, computer science, operations, etc.) should apply, individually or as part of a team. JD students from Harvard Law School and technical students from MIT are encouraged to apply. Enrollment by application only.</font>
