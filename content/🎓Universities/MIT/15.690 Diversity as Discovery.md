<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Aims to help students discover who they are as individuals and members of a community. Course operates under two basic assumptions: that we can accomplish more together than alone, and that a significant part of who we are as individuals is left out of most organizational settings. Confronts the lack of tools and frameworks for dealing with the wealth of diversity among populations, and discusses the value diversity could potentially create.</font>
