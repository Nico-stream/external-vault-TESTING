<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Opportunity to work with interested organizations - or on a startup - to explore and leverage innovation ecosystems, build greater strength in innovation-driven entrepreneurial advantage, and build a stronger culture of corporate innovation. Faculty and students co-create projects along one of two tracks: the innovation track, focused on organizations wishing to become more innovative and/or engage the ecosystem; or the entrepreneurship track, principally for students with startup enterprises/ventures. Further explores themes of innovation ecosystems, stakeholders, and the innovation loop of experimentation and evaluation. Innovation projects are team-based and can be Boston-based. Entrepreneurship projects can be a solo enterprise, but teams are also encouraged. Restricted to second year Executive MBA students.</font>
