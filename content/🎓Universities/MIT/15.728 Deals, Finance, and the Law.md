<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Addresses the challenges managers face in connection with two overlapping responsibilities: negotiating and managing complex deals, and arranging financing. Examines mergers and acquisitions and early-stage investments in young companies; commercial finance, financial instruments, and structured products; and how these relationships and structures play out in the context of financial distress. Emphasizes the opportunities and risks the different parties involved confront. Focuses primarily on the US, but also considers how key legal issues are analyzed in a transnational context. Restricted to Executive MBA and Sloan Fellows students.</font>
