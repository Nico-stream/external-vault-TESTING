<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Applies marketing concepts, analyses and tools used in business-to-business (B2B) marketing. Develops an understanding of customer value management and value quantification as a strategy for delivering superior value to targeted business segments while maintaining equitable returns. Focuses on B2B pricing, brand building, web and technology facilitation of the supply chain, and customer relationship management. Underscores sales force management within the context of go-to-market strategy; however, does not address selling per se. Discusses ethical issues and various B2B contexts, such as products and services, for- and non-profits, and domestic and global markets. Emphasizes applications in technology and healthcare domains. Includes value-based pricing project, case studies, applied exercises, and readings.</font>
