<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Prepares students to formulate the marketing component of overall corporate strategy. Students examine three types of situations: some in which firms leverage their existing competitive advantages; some in which they build new competitive advantages; and some in which a seemingly weaker competitor, such as a start-up, leapfrogs a larger incumbent. Presents material through a combination of cases, lectures, and a group project.</font>
