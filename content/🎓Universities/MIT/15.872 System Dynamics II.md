<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Emphasizes tools and methods needed to apply systems thinking and simulation modeling successfully in diverse real-world settings, including supply chains, forecasting, project management, process improvement, service operations, and platform-based businesses, among others. Uses simulation models, management flight simulators, and case studies to deepen the conceptual and modeling skills introduced in 15.871. Through models and case studies of successful applications students develop proficiency in how to use qualitative and quantitative data to formulate and test models, and how to work effectively with senior executives to implement change successfully. Expectations and evaluation criteria differ for students taking half-term graduate version; consult syllabus or instructor for specific details.</font>
