<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Builds on 15.900 and 15.902 to explore key concepts that have shaped the field of strategic management teaching and strategy consulting over the past several decades. Uses lectures, readings, case studies, and videos to review the evolution of strategy teaching, research, and practice; differences between analytical versus prescriptive tools for strategic thinking and planning; external versus internal influences on financial results; and sources of enduring competitive advantage. Key themes include the role of CEO leadership in strategy formulation and execution, how to view company performance in context, and the role of platform strategies as a tool for competition in the digital age.</font>
