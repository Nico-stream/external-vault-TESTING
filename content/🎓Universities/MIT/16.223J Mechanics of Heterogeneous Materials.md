<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials such as thin-film microelectro- mechanical systems (MEMS) materials and advanced filamentary composites, with particular emphasis on laminated structural configurations.  Anisotropic and crystallographic elasticity formulations.  Structure, properties and mechanics of constituents such as films, substrates, active materials, fibers, and matrices including nano- and micro-scale constituents.  Effective properties from constituent properties.  Classical laminated plate theory for modeling structural behavior including extrinsic and intrinsic strains and stresses such as environmental effects.  Introduction to buckling of plates and nonlinear (deformations) plate theory.  Other issues in modeling heterogeneous materials such as fracture/failure of laminated structures.</font>
