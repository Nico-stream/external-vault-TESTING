<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Considers the challenge of achieving net-zero climate impacts, as well as the opportunities presented by the resurgence of investment in new or renewed ideas. Explores advanced propulsion concepts that are not in use or well-developed, but that have established operation principles and could either contribute to environmental performance or are applicable to new aerospace services. Topics vary but may include: electric and turbo-electric aircraft propulsion; batteries, cryogenic fuels, and biofuels; combustion and emissions control concepts; propulsion for UAVs and urban air mobility; propulsion for supersonic and hypersonic vehicles; reusable space access vehicle propulsion; and propulsion in very low earth orbit. Includes a project to evaluate an advanced propulsion concept.</font>
