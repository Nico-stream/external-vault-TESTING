<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Develops leadership, teamwork and communication skills by exposing students to leadership frameworks, models, and cases within an engineering context in an interactive, practice-based environment. Students are members of and lead teams, participate in guided reflections on individual and team successes, and discover opportunities for improvement in controlled settings. Experiential learning includes design-implement activities, role-play simulations, small group discussions, and performance and peer assessments by and of other students. Includes frequent engineering industry-guest participation. Content is frequently student-driven. First year Gordon Engineering Leadership Program (GEL) students register for 6.9110. Second year GEL Program students register for 6.9130. Preference to students enrolled in the Bernard M. Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership Program.</font>
