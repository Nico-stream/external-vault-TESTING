<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Students attend and participate in a four-day off-site workshop covering an introduction to basic principles, methods, and tools for project management in a realistic context. In teams, students create a plan for a project of their choice in one of several areas, including: aircraft modification, factory automation, flood prevention engineering, solar farm engineering, small-business digital transformation/modernization, and disaster response, among others. Develops skills applicable to the planning and management of complex engineering projects. Topics include cost-benefit analysis, resource and cost estimation, and project control and delivery which are practiced during an experiential, team-based activity. Case studies highlight projects in both hardware/software and consumer packaged goods. Preference to students in the Bernard M. Gordon-MIT Engineering Leadership Program.</font>
