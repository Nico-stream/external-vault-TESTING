<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on implementation and operation of a flight system. Emphasizes system integration, implementation, and performance verification using methods of experimental inquiry, and addresses principles of laboratory safety. Students refine subsystem designs and fabricate working prototypes. Includes component integration into the full system with detailed analysis and operation of the complete vehicle in the laboratory and in the field, as well as experimental analysis of subsystem performance, comparison with physical models of performance and design goals, and formal review of the overall system design. Knowledge of the engineering design process is helpful. Provides instruction in written and oral communication.</font>
