<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Advanced material in satellite engineering, including the physical implementation of spacecraft hardware and software in payloads and bus subsystems, including structures, attitude determination and control, electrical power systems (EPS), control and data handling (CDH), guidance navigation and control (GNC), thermal management, communications, and others. Examples of spacecraft technologies and design tradeoffs are highlighted based on past, current, and future missions. Emphasis on mission success and identification and preventation of spacecraft and mission failures modes. Prepares students for the design of Earth observation as well as interplanetary science missions. Advanced assignments require computational skills in Matlab or Python and short presentations. Guest speakers from NASA and industry. Serves as a basis for the field examination in space systems.</font>
