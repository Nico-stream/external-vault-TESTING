<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Practical work in a spacecraft laboratory environment, including learning about cleanroom environments, satellite integration, and testing. Topics include handling of electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitive electronics, working in a cleanroom, performing spacecraft component and qualification testing using shaker tables to simulate launch and deployment loads, thermal and vacuum testing, and designing and executing a successful spacecraft/instrument test campaign. Emphasis on obtaining laboratory data from sensors such as accelerometers, thermal sensors, and small satellite hardware, and comparing expected results against actual behaviors. Students carry out exercises in small teams and submit digital laboratory reports.</font>
