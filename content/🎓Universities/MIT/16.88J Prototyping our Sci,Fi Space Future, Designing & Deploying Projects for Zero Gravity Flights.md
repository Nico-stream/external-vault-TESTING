<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Instruction in project development, prototyping, and deployment readiness for parabolic flights. Admitted student teams are offered flyer and project-deployment slots on the Space Exploration Initiative's spring parabolic flight, upon successful completion of the course in the fall and integration with the flight provider. Covers three main topic areas: 1) rapid prototyping and engineering skills to prepare projects for operation in microgravity; 2) logistics, training, and safety pre-approval steps to meet flight readiness requirements and pass a Technical Readiness Review (TRR); and 3) creative and technical lenses for the future of space exploration, examining the MIT Space Exploration Initiative's design and prototyping approach, and MIT parabolic flight research examples across Science, Engineering, Art, and Design, and across departments. Enrollment limited; admission by application.</font>
