<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Analyzes the development of the US Congress by focusing on the competing theoretical lenses through which legislatures have been studied. Particularly compares sociological and economic models of legislative behavior, applying those models to floor decision-making, committee behavior, political parties, relations with other branches of the Federal government, and elections. Students taking the graduate version are expected to pursue the subject in greater depth through reading and individual research.</font>
