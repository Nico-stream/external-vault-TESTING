<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines how group identities are recorded as "data" in various domains, and the effects of data collection on the formation of identities, inequality, redistribution and conflict around the world. Compares approaches to recording personal information on household censuses and surveys, college admissions forms, via automated, computer-based systems (AI), and other systems. Draws upon a wide variety of primary materials, and scholarly works from political science, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics.</font>
