<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Emerging democracies are now confronted with what has been termed "the torturer problem." The questions are old ones: What is to be done about the perpetrator(s) and what is to be done for the abused? Seminar broadly examines the theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the  issues commonly associated with "transitional justice," including its motivations, agents, institutions, and decisions. Cases are drawn from various countries and historical periods, including post-World War II Europe, 19th-century America, and 20th-century Africa and Latin America.</font>
