<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to computational molecular biology with a focus on the basic computational algorithms used to solve problems in practice. Covers classical techniques in the field for solving problems such as genome sequencing, assembly, and search; detecting genome rearrangements; constructing evolutionary trees; analyzing mass spectrometry data; connecting gene expression to cellular function; and machine learning for drug discovery. Prior knowledge of biology is not required. Particular emphasis on problem solving, collaborative learning, theoretical analysis, and practical implementation of algorithms. Students taking graduate version complete additional and more complex assignments.</font>
