<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces mechanical behavior of engineering materials, and the use of materials in mechanical design.  Emphasizes the fundamentals of mechanical behavior of materials, as well as design with materials.  Major topics: elasticity, plasticity, limit analysis, fatigue, fracture, and creep.  Materials selection.  Laboratory experiments involving projects related to materials in mechanical design. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity; preference to Course 2 majors and minors.</font>
