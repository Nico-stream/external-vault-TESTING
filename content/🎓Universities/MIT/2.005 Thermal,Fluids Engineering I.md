<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Integrated development of the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer, with applications. Focuses on the first and second laws of thermodynamics, mass conservation, and momentum conservation, for both closed and open systems. Entropy generation and its influence on the performance of engineering systems. Introduction to dimensionless numbers. Introduction to heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. Steady-state and transient conduction. Finned surfaces. The heat equation and the lumped capacitance model. Coupled and uncoupled fluid models. Hydrostatics. Inviscid flow analysis and Bernoulli equation. Navier-Stokes equation and its solutions. Viscous internal flows, head losses, and turbulence. Introduction to pipe flows and Moody chart.</font>
