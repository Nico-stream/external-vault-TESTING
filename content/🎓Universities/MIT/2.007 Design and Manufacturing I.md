<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Develops students' competence and self-confidence as design engineers. Emphasis on the creative design process bolstered by application of physical laws. Instruction on how to complete projects on schedule and within budget. Robustness and manufacturability are emphasized. Subject relies on active learning via a major design-and-build project. Lecture topics include idea generation, estimation, concept selection, visual thinking, computer-aided design (CAD), mechanism design, machine elements, basic electronics, technical communication, and ethics. Lab fee. Limited enrollment. Pre-registration required for lab assignment; special sections by lottery only.</font>
