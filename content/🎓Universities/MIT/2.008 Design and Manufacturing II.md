<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Integration of design, engineering, and management disciplines and practices for analysis and design of manufacturing enterprises. Emphasis is on the physics and stochastic nature of manufacturing processes and systems, and their effects on quality, rate, cost, and flexibility. Topics include process physics and control, design for manufacturing, and manufacturing systems. Group project requires design and fabrication of parts using mass-production and assembly methods to produce a product in quantity. Six units may be applied to the General Institute Lab Requirement. Satisfies 6 units of Institute Laboratory credit. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity; preference to Course 2 majors and minors.</font>
