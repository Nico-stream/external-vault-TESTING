<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Students develop an understanding of product development phases and experience working in teams to design and construct high-quality product prototypes. Design process learned is placed into a broader development context. Primary goals are to improve ability to reason about design alternatives and apply modeling techniques appropriate for different development phases; understand how to gather and process customer information and transform it into engineering specifications; and use teamwork to resolve the challenges in designing and building a substantive product prototype. Instruction and practice in oral communication provided. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity; preference to Course 2 seniors.</font>
