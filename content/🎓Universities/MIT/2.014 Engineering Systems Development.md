<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on implementation and operation of engineering systems. Emphasizes system integration and performance verification using methods of experimental inquiry. Students refine their subsystem designs and the fabrication of working prototypes. Includes experimental analysis of subsystem performance and comparison with physical models of performance and with design goals. Component integration into the full system, with detailed analysis and operation of the complete vehicle in the laboratory and in the field. Includes written and oral reports. Students carry out formal reviews of the overall system design. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication provided. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity; preference to Course 2 majors and minors.</font>
