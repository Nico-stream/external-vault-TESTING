<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Complete cycle of designing an ocean system using computational design tools for the conceptual and preliminary design stages. Team projects assigned, with each student responsible for a specific subsystem. Lectures cover hydrodynamics; structures; power and thermal aspects of ocean vehicles, environment, materials, and construction for ocean use; generation and evaluation of design alternatives. Focus on innovative design concepts chosen from high-speed ships, submersibles, autonomous vehicles, and floating and submerged deep-water offshore platforms. Lectures on ethics in engineering practice included. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication provided. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity; preference to Course 2 seniors.</font>
