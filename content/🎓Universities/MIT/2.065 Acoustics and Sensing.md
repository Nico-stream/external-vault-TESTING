<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the fundamental concepts of acoustics and sensing with waves. Provides a unified theoretical approach to the physics of image formation through scattering and wave propagation in sensing. The linear and nonlinear acoustic wave equation, sources of sound, including musical instruments. Reflection, refraction, transmission and absorption. Bearing and range estimation by sensor array processing, beamforming, matched filtering, and focusing. Diffraction, bandwidth, ambient noise and reverberation limitations. Scattering from objects, surfaces and volumes by Green's Theorem. Forward scatter, shadows, Babinet's principle, extinction and attenuation. Ray tracing and waveguides in remote sensing. Applications to acoustic, radar, seismic, thermal and optical sensing and exploration. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
