<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Complex problems in solid mechanics for a wide range of applications require a knowledge of the foundational balance laws of mechanics, thermodynamics, and electrodynamics of continua, together with a knowledge of the structure and properties of the materials which are provided by particular constitutive models for the so-called smart-materials, and the materials used in the many applications that involve thermo-, chemo-, electro- and/or magneto-mechanical coupling. Reviews the basic balance laws and the constitutive equations of the classical coupled theories of thermoelasticity and poroelasticity, and provides an introduction to the nonlinear theories of electroelasticity and magnetoelasticity. Examines the governing coupled partial differential equations and suitable boundary conditions. Discusses numerical solutions of the partial differential equations.</font>
