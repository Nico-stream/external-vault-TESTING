<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Response of systems to stochastic excitation with design applications. Linear time-invariant systems, convolution, Fourier and Laplace transforms. Probability and statistics. Discrete and continuous random variables, derived distributions. Stochastic processes, auto-correlation. Stationarity and ergodicity, power spectral density. Systems driven by random functions, Wiener-Khinchine theorem.Â  Sampling and filtering. Short- and long-term statistics, statistics of extremes. Problems from mechanical vibrations and statistical linearization, statistical mechanics, and system prediction/identification. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments and a short-term project.</font>
