<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Lays the foundation of adaptive control, and investigates its interconnections with machine learning. Explores fundamental principles of adaptive control, including parameter estimation, recursive algorithms, stability properties, and conditions for convergence. Studies their relationship with machine learning, including the minimization of a performance error and fast convergence. Discusses robustness and regularization in both fields. Derives conditions of learning and implications of imperfect learning. Examines the trade-off between stability and learning. Focuses throughout the term on dynamic systems and on problems where real-time control is needed. Uses examples from aerospace, propulsion, automotive, and energy systems to elucidate the underlying concepts.</font>
