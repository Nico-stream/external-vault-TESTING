<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in engineering design applications. Emphasizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to design new products or systems or solve complex engineering problems. Lectures cover the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and optimization methods. Challenge problems, research paper discussions, and interactive in-class activities are used to highlight the unique challenges of machine learning for design applications. A group term project on students' applications of interest. Basic programming and machine learning familiarity are recommended. StudentsÂ taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
