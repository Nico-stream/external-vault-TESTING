<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces fundamental concepts and encourages open-ended exploration of the increasingly topical intersection between artificial intelligence and the physical sciences. Energy and information, and their respective optimality conditions are used to define supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms; as well as ordinary and partial differential equations. Subsequently, physical systems with complex constitutive relationships are drawn from elasticity, biophysics, fluid mechanics, hydrodynamics, acoustics, and electromagnetics to illustrate how machine learning-inspired optimization can approximate solutions to forward and inverse problems in these domains.</font>
