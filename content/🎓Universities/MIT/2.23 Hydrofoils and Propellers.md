<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Reviews the theory and design of hydrofoil sections; lifting and thickness problems for sub-cavitating sections and unsteady flow problems. Covers lifting line and lifting surface theory with applications to hydrofoil craft, rudder, control surface, propeller and wind turbine rotor design. Topics include propeller lifting line and lifting surface theory; wake adapted propellers, steady and unsteady propeller thrust and torque; waterjets; performance analysis and design of wind turbine rotors. Presents numerical principles of vortex lattice and lifting surface panel methods. Projects illustrate the development of theoretical and computational methods for lifting, propulsion and wind turbine applications.</font>
