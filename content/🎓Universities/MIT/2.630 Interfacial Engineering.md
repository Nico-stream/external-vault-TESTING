<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Interfacial interactions are ubiquitous in many industries including energy, water, agriculture, medical, transportation, and consumer products. Transport processes are typically limited by interfaces. Addresses how interfacial properties (eg., chemistry, morphology, thermal, electrical) can be engineered for significant efficiency enhancements. Topics include surface tension and wetting phenomena, thermodynamics of interfaces, surface chemistry and morphology, nonwetting, slippery, and superwetting surfaces, charged interfaces and electric double layers, intermolecular forces, Van der Waals and double-layer forces, DLVO theory, electrowetting and electro-osmotic flows, electrochemical bubbles, surfactants, phase transitions, and bio-interfaces. Manufacturing approaches, entrepreneurial efforts to translate technologies to markets, guest lectures and start-up company tours provide real-world exposure.Â  Anticipated enrollment is 15-20.</font>
