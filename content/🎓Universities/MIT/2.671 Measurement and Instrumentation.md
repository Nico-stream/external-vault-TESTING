<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces fundamental concepts and experimental techniques for observation and measurement of physical variables such as force and motion, liquid and gas properties, physiological parameters, and measurements of light, sound, electrical quantities, and temperature. Emphasizes mathematical techniques including uncertainty analysis and statistics, Fourier analysis, frequency response, and correlation functions. Uses engineering knowledge to select instruments and design experimental methods to obtain and interpret meaningful data. Guided learning during lab experiments promotes independent experiment design and measurements performed outside the lab in the semester-long "Go Forth and Measure" project. Advances students' ability to critically read, evaluate, and extract specific technical meaning from information in a variety of media, and provides extensive instruction and practice in written, graphical, and oral communication. Enrollment limited.</font>
