<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers advanced nanoengineering via practical lab modules in connection with classical fluid dynamics, mechanics, thermodynamics, and material physics. Labs include microfluidic systems, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), emerging nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nanoimaging tools. Student teams lead an experimental term project that uses the tools and knowledge acquired through the lab modules and experimental work, and culminates in a report and presentation. Recitations cover idea development, experiment design, planning and execution, and analysis of results pertinent to the project. Enrollment limited.</font>
