<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Design and experimental observation for ocean engineering systems focusing on the fundamentals of ocean wave propagation, ocean wave spectra and wave dispersion, cavitation, added mass, acoustic sound propagation in water, sea loads on offshore structures, design of experiments for ship model testing, fish-like swimming propulsion, propellers, and ocean energy harvesting. Emphasizes fundamentals of data analysis of signals from random environments using Fourier transforms, noise filtering, statistics and error analysis using MATLAB. Students carry out experiential laboratory exercises in various Ocean Engineering laboratories on campus, including short labs and demos, longer exercises with written reports, and a final experimental design project. Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory capacity.</font>
