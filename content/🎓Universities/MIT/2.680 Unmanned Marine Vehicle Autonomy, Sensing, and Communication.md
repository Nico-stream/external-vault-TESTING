<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on software and algorithms for autonomous decision making (autonomy) by underwater vehicles operating in ocean environments. Discusses how autonomous marine vehicles (UMVs) adapt to the environment for improved sensing performance. Covers sensors for acoustic, biological and chemical sensing and their integration with the autonomy system for environmentally adaptive undersea mapping and observation. Introduces students to the underwater acoustic communication environment and various options for undersea navigation, highlighting their relevance to the operation of collaborative undersea networks for environmental sensing. Labs involve the use of the MOOP-IvP autonomy software for the development of integrated sensing, modeling and control solutions. Solutions modeled in simulation environments and include field tests with small autonomous surface and underwater vehicles operated on the Charles River. Limited enrollment.</font>
