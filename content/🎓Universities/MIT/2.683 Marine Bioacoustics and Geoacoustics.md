<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Both active and passive acoustic methods of measuring marine organisms, the seafloor, and their interactions are reviewed.  Acoustic methods of detecting, observing, and quantifying marine biological organisms are described, as are acoustic methods of measuring geological properties of the seafloor, including depth, and surficial and volumetric composition.  Interactions are also described, including effects of biological scatterers on geological measurements, and effects of seafloor scattering on measurements of biological scatterers on, in, or immediately above the seafloor.  Methods of determining small-scale material properties of organisms and the seafloor are outlined. Operational methods are emphasized, and corresponding measurement theory is described.  Case studies are used in illustration.  Principles of acoustic-system calibration are elaborated.</font>
