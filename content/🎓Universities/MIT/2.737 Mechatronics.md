<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to designing mechatronic systems, which require integration of the mechanical and electrical engineering disciplines within a unified framework. Significant laboratory-based design experiences form subject's core. Final project. Topics include: low-level interfacing of software with hardware; use of high-level graphical programming tools to implement real-time computation tasks; digital logic; analog interfacing and power amplifiers; measurement and sensing; electromagnetic and optical transducers; control of mechatronic systems. Limited to 20.</font>
