<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines structured principles and processes to develop concepts for large and complex systems. Term projects introduce students to large-scale system development with several areas of emphasis, including idea generation, concept development and refinement, system-level thinking, briefing development and presentation, and proposal generation. Interactive lectures and presentations guide students throughout the course to develop and deliver team presentations focused on solving large and complex problems. Includes a semester-long project in which students apply design tools/processes to solve a specific problem. Students taking graduate version complete the project individually.</font>
