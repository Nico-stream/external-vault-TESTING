<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to manufacturing processes and manufacturing systems including assembly, machining, injection molding, casting, thermoforming, and more. Emphasis on the physics and randomness and how they influence quality, rate, cost, and flexibility. Attention to the relationship between the process and the system, and the process and part design. Project (in small groups) requires fabrication (and some design) of a product using several different processes (as listed above). Enrollment may be limited due to laboratory constraints; preference given to MechE students and students who need to satisfy degree requirements.</font>
