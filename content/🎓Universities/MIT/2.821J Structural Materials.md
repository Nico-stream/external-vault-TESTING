<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines theoretical and practical aspects of structural materials by discussing mechanical properties of materials and manufacturing processes used to convert raw materials into high performance and reliable components for particular applications. Discusses specific types of steel, aluminum, titanium, ceramics, cement, polymer,s and composites in context of commercially available product designations and specifications. Examines manufacturing processes used for exemplar products of each type of material, such as heat treatments, sintering, and injection molding, among others. Considers established methods of metallurgical failure analysis and fractography through product failure case studies in order to prepare students to determine root causes of component failures in the real world. Students taking graduate version submit additional work. Meets with 3.171 when offered concurrently.</font>
