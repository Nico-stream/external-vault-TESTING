<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides ways to analyze manufacturing systems in terms of material flow and storage, information flow, capacities, and times and durations of events. Fundamental topics include probability, inventory and queuing models, forecasting, optimization, process analysis, and linear and dynamic systems. Factory planning and scheduling topics include flow planning, bottleneck characterization, buffer and batch-size tactics, seasonal planning, and dynamic behavior of production systems. Graduate students are required to complete additional assignments with stronger analytical content.</font>
