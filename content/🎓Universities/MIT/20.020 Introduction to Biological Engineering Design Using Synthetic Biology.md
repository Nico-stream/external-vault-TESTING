<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Project-based introduction to the engineering of synthetic biological systems. Throughout the term, students develop projects that are responsive to real-world problems of their choosing, and whose solutions depend on biological technologies. Lectures, discussions, and studio exercises introduce components and control of prokaryotic and eukaryotic behavior; DNA synthesis, standards, and abstraction in biological engineering; and issues of human practice, including biological safety, security, ethics and ownership, sharing, and innovation. Students may have the option to continue projects for participation in the iGEM competition. Preference to first-year students.</font>
