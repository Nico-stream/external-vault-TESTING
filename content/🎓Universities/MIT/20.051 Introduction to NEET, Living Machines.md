<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on physiomimetics: transforming therapeutic strategy and development. Overview of development of therapies for complex diseases, including disease mechanisms in heterogeneous patient populations, developing therapeutic strategies, modeling these in vitro, and testing the therapies. Explores the five essential technological contributions to this process: computational systems biology, synthetic biology, immuno-engineering, microphysiological systems devices/tissue engineering, and microfluidic device engineering for in vitro models and analysis. Introduces disease modeling, patient stratification, and drug development processes, includes extensive examples from industry, and provides context for choosing a concentration track in the Living Machines thread. Weekly lectures from experts in the field supplemented with structured, short projects in each topic area. Limited to 24; preference to students in the NEET Living Machines thread.</font>
