<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces experimental biochemical and molecular techniques from a quantitative engineering perspective. Experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication form the underpinnings of this subject. In this, students complete discovery-based experimental modules drawn from current technologies and active research projects of BE faculty. Generally, topics include DNA engineering, in which students design, construct, and use genetic material; parts engineering, emphasizing protein design and quantitative assessment of protein performance; systems engineering, which considers genome-wide consequences of genetic perturbations; and biomaterials engineering, in which students use biologically-encoded devices to design and build materials. Enrollment limited; priority to Course 20 majors.</font>
