<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Illustrates how knowledge and principles of biology, biochemistry, and engineering are integrated to create new products for societal benefit. Uses case study format to examine recently developed products of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries: how a product evolves from initial idea, through patents, testing, evaluation, production, and marketing. Emphasizes scientific and engineering principles, as well as the responsibility scientists, engineers, and business executives have for the consequences of their technology. Instruction and practice in written and oral communication provided. Enrollment limited; preference to Course 20 undergraduates.</font>
