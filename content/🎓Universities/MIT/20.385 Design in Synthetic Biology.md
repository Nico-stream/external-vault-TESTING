<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides an understanding of the state of research in synthetic biology and development of project management skills. Critical evaluation of primary research literature covering a range of approaches to the design, modeling and programming of cellular behaviors. Focuses on developing the skills needed to read, present and discuss primary research literature, and to manage and lead small teams. Students mentor a small undergraduate team of 20.020 students. Open to advanced students with appropriate background in biology. Students may have the option to continue projects for participation in the iGEM competition.</font>
