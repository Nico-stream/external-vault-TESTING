<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">This discovery subject will expose first-year students to the 21G curriculum through exposure to the importance of global languages in our local community. Introduces Boston's multilingual richness and vibrant immigrant communities through an exploration of the city's diverse cultures and neighborhoods. Readings and films provide an overview of Boston's recent immigrant profile, document key issues within immigrant communities, and provide testimonies of lived experience. Field trips and guest speakers allow students to learn from organizations working with immigrants in Boston neighborhoods. Students have the option to produce a blog to document their findings and report on an immigrant community, struggle, or testimony. Class meets every other week over the course of the term. Subject can count toward the 6-unit discovery-focused credit limit for first-year students. Limited to 16; preference for first-year students.</font>
