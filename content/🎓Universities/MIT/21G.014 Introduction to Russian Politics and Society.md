<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces students to contemporary Russia through analysis of major political, social, and cultural trends and addresses how they have developed due to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Considers the role of identity, state propaganda, civil society — including those in exile — and music both as an instrument of political power and popular resistance. Study materials include academic and media articles, recent documentaries, and video interviews with prominent figures in Russian science and culture. Subject can count toward the 6-unit discovery-focused credit limit for first year students. Limited to 15.</font>
