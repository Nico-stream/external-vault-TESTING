<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Taught on-site at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. Consolidates foundations built in Regular Chinese I-III and Streamlined I; continues instruction of skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. Encourages development of a sensitivity to linguistically-appropriate behavior, introduces extensive vocabulary and usage as a basis for conversational development, and provides a step-by-step guide to the principles and practice of reading and writing Chinese short narratives. Addresses issues of how cultural differences inform and are informed by different linguistic contexts and practices. Taught in Chinese. Limited to 16.</font>
