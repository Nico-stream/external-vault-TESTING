<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the cultural trends and media habits of Chinese Generation X and the post-1990s generation, and its context of the rise of Web culture.  Topics include the influence of the global Web culture on China; the cross-fertilization of youth volunteer culture and Web 2.0; popular sites where Chinese college students and other youths congregate, including BBS forums and social networking platforms; and the debates in online communities that made an impact on Chinese politics and society.  Students examine literature on the evolution of Chinese Web culture and conduct exercises using Web 2.0 tools.  Taught in Chinese.</font>
