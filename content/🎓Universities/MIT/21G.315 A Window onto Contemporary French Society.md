<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Intermediate subject designed to help students gradually build an in-depth understanding of France. Focuses on French attitudes and values regarding education, work, family, and institutions. Deals with the differing notions that underlie interpersonal interactions and communication styles, such as politeness, friendship, and formality. Using a Web comparative, cross-cultural approach, students explore a variety of French and American materials, then analyze and compare using questionnaires, opinion polls, news reports (in different media), as well as a variety of historical, anthropological and literary texts. Students involved in team research projects. Attention given to the development of relevant linguistics skills. Recommended for students planning to study and work in France. Taught in French.</font>
