<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Studies the transformation of childhood and youth since the 18th century in France, as well as the development of sentimentality within the family in a francophone context. Examines the personification of children, both as a source of inspiration for artistic creation and a political ideal aimed at protecting future generations. Considers various representations of childhood and youth in literature (e.g., Pagnol, Proust, Sarraute, Laye, Morgi√©vre), movies (e.g., Truffaut), and songs (e.g., Brel, Barbara). Taught in French.</font>
