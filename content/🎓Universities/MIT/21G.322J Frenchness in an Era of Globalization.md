<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Approaches the question of what constitutes Frenchness in today's era of globalization through issues of memory, belonging, and cultural production. Explores the role of timeless traditions - common technologies, an internationally-spoken language, monuments open to the world, and foods such as wine and cheese - remain quintessentially French. Also covers recent scandals about France's role in the world, such as its colonial identity and Dominique Strauss-Kahn's New York debacle. Taught in French. Limited to 18.</font>
