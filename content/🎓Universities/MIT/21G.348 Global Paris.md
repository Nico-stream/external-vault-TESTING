<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Investigates Paris' oversized status as a global capital by looking at the events, transformations, cultures, and arts for which the city is known. Explores Paris as a magnet for immigrants, and how their presence has transformed the city. Takes into account the city as a mythic place, dreamed of and reconstructed as far away as Bollywood and Las Vegas. Provides a deeper understanding of Paris and its current place in French and global cultures. Taught in French.</font>
