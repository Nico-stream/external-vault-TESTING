<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines French politics since 1958. Analyzes how politics has deeply influenced cultural and social life in France, including daily interactions. Questions public controversies and history's political cleavages, from the Algerian war to postcolonial issues, from the birth of the European construction to the Covid crisis. To explore French institutions and understand the impact of political issues in contemporary France, students "run" for the French presidency by preparing historical notes, delivering speeches, participating in a first-round presidential debate, and submitting a final political statement. Taught in French. Limited to 25.</font>
