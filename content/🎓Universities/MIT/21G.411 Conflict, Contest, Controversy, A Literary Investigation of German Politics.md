<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Investigates political and historical happenings in German-speaking countries through an examination of politically informed literature and art from the past 120 years. Moves topically, analyzing a wide range of genres and literary movements through lenses such as propaganda, religion, art and extremism, immigration and language, and imaginaries of both the past and the future. Focuses on exploring the dialogues and points of contact between creators and historic- political moments from the early 1900s to the present day, unearthing answers to questions about the past, present, and future of German identity. Taught in German. 18 for pedagogical reasons.</font>
