<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Builds advanced Japanese skills that can be applied to real-life issues and/or problems through project-based learning. Focuses on topics in technology, science, and society, such as AI, robotics, environment issues, social justice, the global pandemic, etc. Develops communicative skills (e.g., explaining, expressing opinions, describing) and expands vocabularies and expressions through class debates and discussions. Students conduct two projects (individual and group) to create quality end-products, using digital technologies (e.g., video, 360 images, VR). In-class time devoted to project progress reports and tangible outcomes; Zoom sessions are used for questions and individualized feedback about the projects. Taught entirely in Japanese. Limited to 16 for pedagogical reasons.</font>
