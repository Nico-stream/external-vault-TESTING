<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Designed for students who have conversational skills (typically gained from growing up in a Spanish speaking environment) without a corresponding level of literacy. Builds upon students' existing linguistic and cultural knowledge to develop competence and confidence in using the language in more formal contexts. Examines a variety of texts and genres, music, films and visual arts, in order to enrich vocabulary, improve grammatical accuracy, and gain a greater social, cultural, political, and historical understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. Taught in Spanish. Limited to 18.</font>
