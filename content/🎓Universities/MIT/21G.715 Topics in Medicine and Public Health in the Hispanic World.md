<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Strengthens oral and written communication skills in Spanish by examining current topics in medicine and public health. Explores medical and health challenges in various Hispanic nations and among Spanish-speaking communities in the US. Topics include cultural narratives of illness, bioethical considerations of genetic research, women's reproductive rights, Cuba's export of healthcare workers, the ethical implications of medical decision-making, and euthanasia. Draws on sources from the humanities, social sciences and the arts that incorporate diverse perspectives on these issues. Focuses on the use of language in the construction of cultural metaphors and representations of illness and healing. Taught in Spanish. Limited to 18.</font>
