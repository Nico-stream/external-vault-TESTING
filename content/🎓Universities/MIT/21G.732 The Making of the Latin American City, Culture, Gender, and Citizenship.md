<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores paradigms of Latin American modernity, gender, and urban cultures through primary texts and media. Examines a range of materials (literature, films, visual arts, music, and advertising) to reflect on the region's urbanization processes of the 20th and 21st centuries. Focuses on the production and representation of gender - and women, in particular - as key subjects of urbanization, mass media, and consumer culture. Discussions travel through urban centers as different as Buenos Aires, Mexico DF, Lima, Havana, Miami and New York, but are organized around four critical categories: urban spaces, labor, leisure, and citizenship. Taught in Spanish.</font>
