<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Presents an overview of Brazilian history, art, and culture from the late 19th century to the present day. Topics covered are woven into the larger theme of popular Brazilian music, and include the Modern Art Week of 1922, CÃ¢ndido Portinari's paintings, the Tropicalist art movement, and the role of artists and intellectuals during and after the military dictatorship. Identifies and distinguishes the main Brazilian musical styles, connecting them to specific historical periods and events, discussing how they reflect different notions of identity, and analyzing cultural production from a transnational perspective. Practice in listening, speaking, reading, and writing is provided, with strong emphasis on developing critical thinking. Taught in Portuguese. Limited to 18.</font>
