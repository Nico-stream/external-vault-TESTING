<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines human concern about the planet and how that fixation shapes concepts of time &amp; space, knowledge-production, understandings of what it means to be human and non-human, as well as trends in scholarship, art, culture &amp; politics. Indexes the way numerous actors and institutions came to understand, debate &amp; narrate the Anthropocene, a geological epoch defined by human-induced climate change. Explores how it as a concept has opened up new ways of understanding relations within the planet, including care, accountability &amp; multi-species mutualism. Considers narrative registers as well, how scholars, writers, artists &amp; working people narrate the Anthropocene. Students undertake an original project in research &amp;/or experimental narrative forms inspired by the reading. Limited to 12.</font>
