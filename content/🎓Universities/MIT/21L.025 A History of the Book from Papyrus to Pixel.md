<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Studies a broad range of texts and artifacts related to the history of writing and reading across cultures. Introduces students to the history and theory of media, to literary topics such as metafiction and narratology, and to the study of rare books and distinctive collections. Readings vary but may include literary works by authors such as Miguel Cervantes, Emily Dickinson, and Italo Calvino and theoretical writing by scholars including Marshall McLuhan and Roland Barthes. Regular sessions in MIT Libraries lead to capstone research projects on objects in MIT Archives and Special Collections. Students present on their readings and research in a variety of forms.</font>
