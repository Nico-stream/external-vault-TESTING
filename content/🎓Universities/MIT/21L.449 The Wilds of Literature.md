<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Immerses students in literature that represents the interaction between humans and nature as joyous, sublime, revelatory, and mutually sustaining. Without denying the damage humans have wreaked on the environment, explores the role that pleasure, resilience, wonder, and hope might play in helping us to envision new modes of engagement with one another in an ever-changing environment. Students are enjoined to follow the example of authors — such as Henry David Thoreau, Annie Dillard, and Lauret Savoy — by selecting and visiting a local natural site, and writing about the experience. May be repeated for credit with permission of instructor if content differs.</font>
