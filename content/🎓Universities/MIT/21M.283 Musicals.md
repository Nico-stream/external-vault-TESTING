<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers Broadway works and Hollywood films in depth. Proceeds chronologically, exploring landmark stage musicals and films, within four historical categories: breakthrough musicals of the 1920s and '30s; classic "book musicals" of the '40s and '50s; modernist and concept musicals of the '60s and '70s; and postmodern and cutting-edge works of the '80s and '90s. Attention given to the role of music in relation to script, characterization, and dramatic structure. Final papers involve comparison of one stage and one film work, selected in consultation with the instructor. Oral presentations required and in-class performances encouraged.</font>
