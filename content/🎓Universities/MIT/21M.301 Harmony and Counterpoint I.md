<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores the fundamental building blocks of Western diatonic music through regular composition and analysis assignments. Focuses on Western classical music, with complementary topics that engage a broader range of historical periods, traditions, and individuals. Topics include rhythm and meter, harmony and counterpoint within a single key, and a brief overview of form and modulation. Individual skills are addressed through a variety of approaches, including keyboard practice in the required piano and sight singing labs. Local musicians perform final composition projects. Students should have experience reading music. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments. Limited to 20 per section.</font>
