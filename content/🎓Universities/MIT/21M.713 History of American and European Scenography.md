<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores the history of visual theater design from the Ancient Greek theater to contemporary practice. Investigates the forces that shape different scenographic approaches, such as historical events, arts patronage, concurrent movements in art and culture, and technological innovations. Introduces students to the strategies, philosophies, and practice utilized by important design practitioners such as Caspar Neher, Lyubov Popova, Ming Cho Lee, Anna Viebrock, Josef Svoboda and others. Discusses how the fictional architecture of the stage intersects with the material culture. Students choose a designer and develop a project around their work that includes a research paper, a presentation, and the student's recreation of their designs using contemporary visualization technologies. Enrollment limited.</font>
