<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Investigates how people acting as a collective change the status quo, and how art/performance supports and inspires powerful political, social, economic, and cultural shifts. Discusses the connection between art and activism and performance and world-making, from the Haitian Revolution in 1791 to more contemporary examples â€” the 1960s Civil Rights era, 1980s Act Up die-ins, and chanting the names of those killed by police violence in solidarity with #BlackLivesMatter in 2020. Studies how art and artistic tools made change possible in the historical and social fights for justice. Examines the challenges facing the oppressed today with the intention of creating work that will serve to inspire change within communities. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
