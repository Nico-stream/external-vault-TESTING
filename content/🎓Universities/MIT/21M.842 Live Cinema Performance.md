<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Interdisciplinary studio introduces the theoretical basis, technical idiosyncrasies, and artistic practices of Live Cinema Performance. Examines the meaningful integration of live theatrical and cinematic idioms through merging the disciplines of the performer and the director, scenographer and cinematographer, choreographer and filmmaker. Studio exercises, readings, screenings, field trips, and in-class presentations give students the opportunity to study the history and theory surrounding the development of the genre and engage the artistic practice from both sides of the camera. Guest artists, lectures, and master classes deepen the perspective. Each session focuses on a particular dramatist, theme, or artistic genre, culminating in a research-driven, full-length collaboration, to be presented in the final week of class for an invited audience. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Enrollment limited.</font>
