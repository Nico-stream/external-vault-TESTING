<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Instruction for bilingual students in writing short stories and poems in English. Involves the study of craft, revision, and creativity, as well as close reading of important works by American, British, and non-native writers' writing in English. Analyzes "the limits of English" through group discussions of student writing to distinguish linguistic freshness from grammatical incorrectness, with review of relevant rules. Includes academic and non-academic vocabulary building, a formal writing process, literary analysis essays, short translations to and from students' native languages, and the workshopping (peer reviewing) of creative work. Limited to 18.</font>
