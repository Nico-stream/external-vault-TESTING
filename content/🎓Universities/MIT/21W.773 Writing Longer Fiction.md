<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Designed for students who have some experience in writing fiction and want to try longer forms like the novella and novel. Students interested in writing a novel are expected to produce at least two chapters and an outline of the complete work. Readings include several novels from Fitzgerald to the present, and novellas from Gogol's <i>The Overcoat</i> to current examples. Students discuss one another's writing in a roundtable workshop, with a strong emphasis on revision.</font>
