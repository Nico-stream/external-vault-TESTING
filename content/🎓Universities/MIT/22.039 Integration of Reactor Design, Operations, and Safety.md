<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers the integration of reactor physics and engineering sciences into nuclear power plant design, focusing on designs projected to be used in the first half of this century. Topics include materials issues in plant design and operations, aspects of thermal design, fuel depletion and fission-product poisoning, and temperature effects on reactivity. Addresses safety considerations in regulations and operations, such as the evolution of the regulatory process, the concept of defense in depth, general design criteria, accident analysis, probabilistic risk assessment, and risk-informed regulations.Â  Students taking graduate versionÂ complete additional assignments.</font>
