<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Studies the relationship between technical and policy elements of the nuclear fuel cycle. Topics include uranium supply, enrichment, fuel fabrication, in-core reactivity and fuel management of uranium and other fuel types, used fuel reprocessing, and waste disposal. Presents principles of fuel cycle economics and the applied reactor physics of both contemporary and proposed thermal and fast reactors. Examines nonproliferation aspects, disposal of excess weapons plutonium, and transmutation of long lived radioisotopes in spent fuel. Several state-of-the-art computer programs relevant to reactor core physics and heat transfer are provided for student use in problem sets and term papers.Â  Students taking graduate versionÂ complete additional assignments.</font>
