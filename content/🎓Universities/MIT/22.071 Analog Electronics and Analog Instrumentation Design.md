<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Presents the basics of analog electronics, covering everything from basic resistors to non-linear devices such as diodes and transistors. Students build amplifiers with op amps and study the behavior of first- and second-order oscillating circuits. Lectures followed by short laboratory exercises reinforce theoretical knowledge with experiments. Includes project in second half of the term in which students design radiation instruments of their choice (e.g. Geiger radiation counters, or other types of sensors and instruments). Teaches use of Arduino microcontrollers as simple data acquisition systems, allowing for real-time data processing and display. Culminates in student presentations of their designs in an open forum. Limited to 20.</font>
