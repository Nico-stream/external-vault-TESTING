<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Materials play a central role in the ongoing global transformation towards more sustainable means of harvesting, storing, and conserving energy, through better batteries, fuel cells, hydrogen electrolyzers, photovoltaics, and the like. Methods for producing materials such as cement, steel, ammonia, and ethylene, which rank amongst today's largest industrial emitters of greenhouse gases, are being re-invented. Much of this work is taking place at MIT and surrounding cleantech startups. This class discusses the underlying science of selected new technologies, the challenges which must be overcome, and the magnitude of their potential impact. Visits to the startups behind each case study and meetings with the scientists and engineers creating these technologies are included. Subject can count toward 6-unit discovery-focused credit limit for first-year students. Preference to first-year students.</font>
