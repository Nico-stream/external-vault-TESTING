<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Describes the fundamentals of bonding and structure that underpin materials science. Structure of noncrystalline, crystalline, and liquid-crystalline states across length scales including short and long range ordering. Point, line, and surface imperfections in materials. Diffraction and structure determination. Covers molecular geometry and levels of structure in biological materials. Includes experimental and computational exploration of the connections between structure, properties, processing, and performance of materials. Covers methodology of technical communication (written/oral) with a view to integrate experimental design, execution, and analysis.</font>
