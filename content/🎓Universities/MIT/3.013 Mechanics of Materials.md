<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Basic concepts of solid mechanics and mechanical behavior of materials: elasticity, stress-strain relationships, stress transformation, viscoelasticity, plasticity, and fracture. Continuum behavior as well as atomistic explanations of the observed behavior are described. Examples from engineering as well as biomechanics. Lab experiments, computational exercises, and demonstrations give hands-on experience of the physical concepts.</font>
