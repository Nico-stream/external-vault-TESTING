<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers microstructures, defects, and structural evolution in all classes of materials. Topics include solution kinetics, interface stability, dislocations and point defects, diffusion, surface energetics, grains and grain boundaries, grain growth, nucleation and precipitation, and electrochemical reactions. Lectures illustrate a range of examples and applications based on metals, ceramics, electronic materials, polymers, and biomedical materials. Explores the evolution of microstructure through experiments involving optical and electron microscopy, calorimetry, electrochemical characterization, surface roughness measurements, and other characterization methods. Investigates structural transitions and structure-property relationships through practical materials examples.</font>
