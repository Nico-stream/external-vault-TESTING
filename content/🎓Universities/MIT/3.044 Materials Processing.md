<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to materials processing science, with emphasis on heat transfer, chemical diffusion, and fluid flow. Uses an engineering approach to analyze industrial-scale processes, with the goal of identifying and understanding physical limitations on scale and speed. Covers materials of all classes, including metals, polymers, electronic materials, and ceramics. Considers specific processes, such as melt-processing of metals and polymers, deposition technologies (liquid, vapor, and vacuum), colloid and slurry processing, viscous shape forming, and powder consolidation.</font>
