<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Discusses processing and structure of cellular solids as they are created from polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses, and composites; derivation of models for the mechanical properties of honeycombs and foams; and how unique properties of honeycombs and foams are exploited in applications such as lightweight structural panels, energy absorption devices, and thermal insulation. Covers applications of cellular solids in medicine, such as increased fracture risk due to trabecular bone loss in patients with osteoporosis, the development of metal foam coatings for orthopedic implants, and designing porous scaffolds for tissue engineering that mimic the extracellular matrix. Includes modelling of cellular materials applied to natural materials and biomimicking. Offers a combination of online and in-person instruction. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
