<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Builds a foundation of physical principles underlying electrical, optical, and magnetic approaches to neural recording and stimulation. Discusses neural recording probes and materials considerations that influence the quality of the signals and longevity of the probes in the brain. Students then consider physical foundations for optical recording and modulation. Introduces magnetism in the context of biological systems. Focuses on magnetic neuromodulation methods and touches upon magnetoreception in nature and its physical limits. Includes team projects that focus on designing electrical, optical, or magnetic neural interface platforms for neuroscience. Concludes with an oral final exam consisting of a design component and a conversation with the instructor. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
