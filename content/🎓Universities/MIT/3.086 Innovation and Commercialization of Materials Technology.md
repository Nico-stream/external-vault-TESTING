<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the fundamental process of innovating and its role in promoting growth and prosperity. Exposes students to innovation through team projects as a structured process, while developing skills to handle multiple uncertainties simultaneously. Provides training to address these uncertainties through research methods in the contexts of materials technology development, market applications, industry structure, intellectual property, and other factors. Case studies place the project in a context of historical innovations with worldwide impact. Combination of projects and real-world cases help students identify how they can impact the world through innovation.</font>
