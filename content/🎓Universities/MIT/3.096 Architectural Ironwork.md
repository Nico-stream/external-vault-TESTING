<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores the use of iron in the built environment throughout history and the world, with an emphasis on traditional European and American design and connections to contemporary movements in art and architecture. Discusses influence of technology on design and fabrication, spanning both ancient and modern developments. Cultivates the ability to design iron in architecture and criticize ironwork as art. Includes laboratory exercises that teach a variety of basic and advanced iron-working techniques such as hand forging and CNC machining. The project-based curriculum begins with art criticism of Cambridge-area ironwork, progresses to practical studies of iron architectural elements, and finishes with creation of an architectural object of the student's design. Associated writing assignments for in-lab projects hone criticism and analysis skills. Limited to 6.</font>
