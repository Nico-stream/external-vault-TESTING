<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores human interaction with ceramic materials over a considerable span of time, from 25,000 years ago to the 16th century AD. Through the lens of modern materials science combined with evidence from archaeological investigations, examines ancient ceramic materials — from containers to architecture to art — to better understand our close relationship with this important class of material culture. Examines ceramics structure, properties, and processing. Introduces archaeological perspectives and discusses how research into historical changes in ancient ceramic technologies has led to a deeper comprehension of past human behavior and societal development. Concludes by considering how studies of ancient technologies and techniques are leading modern materials scientists to engineer designs of modern ceramic materials, including glasses, concretes, and pigments. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
