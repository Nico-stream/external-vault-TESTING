<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Optical materials design for semiconductors, dielectrics, organic and nanostructured materials. Ray optics, electromagnetic optics and guided wave optics. Physics of light-matter interactions. Device design principles: LEDs, lasers, photodetectors, solar cells, modulators, fiber and waveguide interconnects, optical filters, and photonic crystals. Device processing: crystal growth, substrate engineering, thin film deposition, etching and process integration for dielectric, silicon and compound semiconductor materials. Micro- and nanophotonic systems. Organic, nanostructured and biological optoelectronics. Assignments include three design projects that emphasize materials, devices and systems applications. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
