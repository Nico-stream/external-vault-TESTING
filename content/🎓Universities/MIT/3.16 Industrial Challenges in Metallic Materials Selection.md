<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Advanced metals and alloy design with emphasis in advanced steels and non-ferrous alloys. Â Applies physical metallurgy concepts to solve specific problems targeting sustainable, efficient and safer engineeredÂ solutions. Â Discusses industrial challenges involving metallic materials selection and manufacturing for different value chains and industrial segments. Includes applications in essential segments of modernÂ life, such as transportation, energy and structural applications. Â Recognizing steel as an essential engineering material, subject covers manufacturing and end-uses of advancedÂ steels ranging from microalloyed steels to highly alloyed steels. Â Also covers materials for very low temperature applications such as superconducting materials and for higher temperature applications such as superalloys. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
