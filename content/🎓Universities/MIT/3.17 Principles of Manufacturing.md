<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Teaches the methodology to achieve Six Sigma materials yield: 99.99966% of end products perform within the required tolerance limits. Six Sigma methodology employs five stages for continuous improvement â€”Â problem definition, quantification, root cause analysis, solution implementation, and process controlÂ  to help engineers evaluate efficiency and assess complex systems. Through case studies, explores classic examples of materials processing problems and the solutions that achieved Six Sigma manufacturing yield throughout the manufacturing system: extraction, design, unit processes, process flow, in-line control, test, performance/qualification, reliability, environmental impact, product life cycle, cost, and workforce. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
