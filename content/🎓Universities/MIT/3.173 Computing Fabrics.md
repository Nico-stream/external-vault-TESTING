<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Highlights connections between industrialization, products, and advances in fibers and fabrics. Discusses the evolution of technologies in their path from basic scientific research to scaled production and global markets, with the ultimate objective of identifying and investigating the degrees of freedom that make fabrics such a powerful form of synthetic engineering and product expression. Topics explored, in part through interactions with industry speakers, include: fiber, yarn, textiles and fabric materials, structure-property relations, and practical demonstrations to anticipate future textile products. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Limited to 20.</font>
