<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Develops the materials principles, limitations, and challenges of clean energy technologies, including solar, energy storage, thermoelectrics, fuel cells, and novel fuels. Draws correlations between the limitations and challenges related to key figures of merit and the basic underlying thermodynamic, structural, transport, and physical principles, as well as to the means for fabricating devices exhibiting optimum operating efficiencies and extended life at reasonable cost. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
