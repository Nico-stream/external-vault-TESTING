<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Integrates elements of physics and chemistry toward the study of material surfaces. Begins with classical colloid phenomena and the interaction between surfaces in different media. Discusses the mechanisms of surface charge generation as well as how dispersion forces are created and controlled. Continues with exploration of chemical absorption processes and surface design of inorganic and organic materials. Includes examples in which such surface design can be used to control critical properties of materials in applications. Addresses lastly how liquids interact with solids as viewed by capillarity and wetting phenomena. Studies how materials are used in processes and applications that are intended to control liquids, and how the surface chemistry and structure of those materials makes such applications possible.</font>
