<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers essentials of measurement science, including instrumentation, instrument-computer interfacing, experimental design, calibration and systematic errors, measurement statistics, data representation, and elements of data analysis, including model selection and statistical analysis. Structured around a series of case studies chosen by the class. Options include: electrical and Hall conductivity measurements, semiconductor junction measurements, spectroscopy (including photoluminescence, Raman, and photoelectron), magnetometry, elemental composition analysis and depth profiling, atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation, dynamical correlations and related measurements, and measuring pressure (from ultra-high vacuum to megabar). Familiarity with coding and data analysis required. Specific measurement challenges in the students' own research discussed.</font>
