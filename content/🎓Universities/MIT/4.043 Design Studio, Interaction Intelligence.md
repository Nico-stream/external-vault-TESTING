<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Overview of core principles and techniques for the design of interaction, behavior, and intelligence across objects and spaces. In a studio environment, students develop low and high-fidelity interactive prototypes that can be deployed and experienced by real users. Lectures cover the history and principles of human-computer interaction, behavior prototyping, physical and graphical user interfaces, machine intelligence, neural networks, and large language models. Provides a foundation in technical skills, such as physical prototyping, coding, and electronics, as well as how to collect data, train, and deploy their own neural network models. Students complete a series of small interaction exercises and a portfolio-level final project. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.Â  Limited to 16; preference to 4B majors and Design minors.</font>
