<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on the concept of "fabric" both as a medium and as a framework to explore the complex cultural histories, meanings, and functions of clothing and wearable technologies. Guides students in an exploration of ways in which clothing signals one's belonging to a group and reflects the degree of one's conformity with established social or cultural norms as well as ways in which clothing and fashion may provide insights into broader cultural codes, societal politics, and processes of transformation. Additional work is required of students taking the graduate version. Lab fee required. Limited to 20.</font>
