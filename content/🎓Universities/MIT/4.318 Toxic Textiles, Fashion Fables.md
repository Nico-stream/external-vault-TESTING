<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Critiques the widespread phenomenon of fast fashion and considers the notion of "toxic textiles" to explore the cultural, social, political, economic, and environmental footprint of clothing. Examines the storytelling capacity of the textile medium as an artistic and critical response to the world's pressing concerns. Introduces experimentation with textile art and fashion design, informed case studies in contemporary art, decolonizing fashion, performative and wearable technologies, experimental preservation, and fabric upcycling. Students exhibit one studio-based final project at the end of the term. Sewing skills beneficial but not required. Additional work required of students taking the graduate version. Lab fee required. Limited to 20.</font>
