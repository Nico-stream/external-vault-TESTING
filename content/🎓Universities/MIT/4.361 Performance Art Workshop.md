<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores performance in relation to the body as a space of resistance, the collective body and its powers, and performative acts that blur boundaries between art and life. Students trace gestures of care and conviviality by enacting scores and poetry, altering screens and other walls that divide and separate us, reclaiming time and undoing categories that alienate our bodies from life itself. Activities include contact improvisation, walking, reading, screening, and discussing theoretical, historical, and contemporary issues in relation to performance art. Several small performance-based projects, both collective and individual, assigned throughout the semester. Additional work required of students taking graduate version. Lab fee required. Limited to 20.</font>
