<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides necessary historic awareness and technical skills for becoming agents of change for a carbon neutral building sector by further merging the fields of architectural design and environmental performance analysis. Students are presented with a "typical" building and explore various interventions, from envelope improvements to reduced internal lighting and equipment loads, ventilation and HVAC upgrades as well as onsite deployment of photovoltaics. Discusses which energy flows to pay attention to for different building types and how to productively work with the local microclimate, knowledge which can later promote elevated discussions between architect and environmental consultant. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
