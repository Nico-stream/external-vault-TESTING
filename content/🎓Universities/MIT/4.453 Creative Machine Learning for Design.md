<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on applications of machine learning (ML) for creative design generation and data-informed design exploration, with an emphasis on visual and 3-D generative systems. Explores how recent advances in artificial intelligence, and specifically machine learning, can offer humans more natural, performance-driven design processes. Covers a wide range of machine learning algorithms and their applications to design, with topics including neural networks, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, dimensionality reduction, geometric deep learning, and other ML techniques. Includes an open-ended, applied research or design project demonstrating an original, creative use of machine learning for design, architecture, engineering, or art. Limited to 20.</font>
