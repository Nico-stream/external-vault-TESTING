<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces digital fabrication as a method of home, hut, and shelter delivery/construction. Explores the progression of industrial-based building production from prefab to digital fab. Examines new computational techniques for rapid construction, as well as the basics of tiny building design, 3D modeling systems, scalable ways to prototype, and computer numerical control (CNC) fabrication. Students use lab time to design a prototype of a small building as a single packaged product. Additional work required of students taking graduate version. Lab fee required. Enrollment limited; preference to Course 4 majors and minors.</font>
