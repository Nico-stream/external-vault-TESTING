<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Students carry out an experiment that builds skills in how to rationally design macromolecules for drug delivery based on fundamental principles of physical organic chemistry. Begins with conjugation of a drug molecule to a polymerizable group through a cleavable linker to generate a prodrug monomer. Continues with polymerization of monomer to produce macromolecular (i.e., polymer) prodrug; monomer and polymer prodrugs are fully characterized. Rate of drug release is measured and correlated to the size of the macromolecule as well as the structure of the cleavable linker. Satisfies 4 units of Institute Laboratory credit.</font>
