<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Presents the theoretical and practical fundamentals of continuous flow synthesis, wherein pumps, tubes, and connectors are used to conduct chemical reactions instead of flasks, beakers, etc. Focuses on a catalytic reaction that converts natural vegetable oil into biodiesel that can be used in a variety of combustion engines. Provides instruction in several important organic chemistry experimental techniques, including purification by extraction, rotary evaporation, acid-base titration, gas chromatography (GC), and <sup>1</sup>H NMR.</font>
