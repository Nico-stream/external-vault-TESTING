<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the electrochemical processes that underlie renewable energy storage and recovery. Students investigate charge transfer reactions at electrode surfaces that are critical to the operation of advanced batteries, fuel cells, and electrolyzers. Develops basic theory behind inner- and outer-sphere charge transfer reactions at interfaces and applies this theory to construct mechanistic models for important energy conversion reactions including the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to water and the reduction of protons to H<sub>2</sub>. Students will also synthesize new catalytic materials for these reactions and investigate their relative performance.</font>
