<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Independent research under the direction of a member of the Chemistry Department faculty. Allows students with a strong interest in independent research to fulfill  part of the laboratory requirement for the Chemistry Department Program in the context of a research laboratory at MIT. The research must be conducted on the MIT campus and be a continuation of a previous 12-unit UROP project or full-time work over the summer. Instruction and practice in written and oral communication is provided, culminating in a poster presentation of the work at the annual departmental UROP symposium and a research publication-style writeup of the results.  Permission of the faculty research supervisor and the Chemistry Education Office must be obtained in advance.</font>
