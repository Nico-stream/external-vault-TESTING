<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on understanding the chemicalÂ and biological mechanisms of protein folding, misfolding, aggregation, and quality control. Topics covered include: molecular mechanisms of protein folding; experimental and computational strategies to study protein folding; how cells fold and quality control proteins; protein misfolding and aggregation; proteostasis and human disease; strategies to address protein folding failures in disease; and protein folding in biotechnology development. Provides state-of-the-art understanding of the field, fosters ability to critically assess and use the literature, and empowers students to study and address protein folding issues in their research and beyond.</font>
