<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Equilibrium properties of macroscopic systems. Basic thermodynamics: state of a system, state variables. Work, heat, first law of thermodynamics, thermochemistry. Second and third law of thermodynamics: entropy and free energy, including the molecular basis for these thermodynamic functions. Phase equilibrium and properties of solutions. Chemical equilibrium of reactions in gas and solution phases. Rates of chemical reactions. Special attention to thermodynamics related to global energy issues. Meets with 5.601 first half of term and 5.602 second half of term. Credit cannot also be received for 5.601 or 5.602.</font>
