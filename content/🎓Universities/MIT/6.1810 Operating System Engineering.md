<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Design and implementation of operating systems, and their use as a foundation for systems programming. Topics include virtual memory, file systems, threads, context switches, kernels, interrupts, system calls, interprocess communication, coordination, and interaction between software and hardware. A multi-processor operating system for RISC-V, xv6, is used to illustrate these topics. Individual laboratory assignments involve extending the xv6 operating system, for example to support sophisticated virtual memory features and networking.</font>
