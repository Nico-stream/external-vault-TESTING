<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Fosters deep understanding and intuition that is crucial in innovating analog circuits and optimizing the whole system in bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) technologies. Covers both theory and real-world applications of basic amplifier structures, operational amplifiers, temperature sensors, bandgap references. Covers topics such as noise, linearity and stability. Homework and labs give students access to CAD/EDA tools to design and analyze analog circuits. Provides practical experience through lab exercises, including a broadband amplifier design and characterization. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
