<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the fundamental algorithmic approaches for creating robot systems that can autonomously manipulate physical objects in unstructured environments such as homes and restaurants. Topics include perception (including approaches based on deep learning and approaches based on 3D geometry), planning (robot kinematics and trajectory generation, collision-free motion planning, task-and-motion planning, and planning under uncertainty), as well as dynamics and control (both model-based and learning-based). Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Students engage in extensive written and oral communication exercises.</font>
