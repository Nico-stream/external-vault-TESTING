<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">IntroductionÂ to basic concepts, principles, and implementation issues in the designing of secure hardware systems. Through a mixture of lectures and paper discussions, covers state-of-the-art security attacks and defenses targeting the computer architecture, digital circuits, and physics layers of computerÂ systems. Emphasizes both the conceptual and the practical aspects of security issues in modern hardware systems. Topics include microarchitectural timing side channels, speculative execution attacks, RowHammer, Trusted Execution Environment, physical attacks, hardware support for software security, and verification of digital systems. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
