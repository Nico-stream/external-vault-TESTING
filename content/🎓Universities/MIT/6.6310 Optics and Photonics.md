<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to fundamental concepts and techniques of optics, photonics, and fiber optics, aimed at developing skills for independent research. Topics include: Review of Maxwell's equations, light propagation, reflection and transmission, dielectric mirrors and filters. Scattering matrices, interferometers, and interferometric measurement. Fresnel and Fraunhoffer diffraction theory. Lenses, optical imaging systems, and software design tools. Gaussian beams, propagation and resonator design. Optical waveguides, optical fibers and photonic devices for encoding and detection. Discussion of research operations / funding and professional development topics. The course reviews and introduces mathematical methods and techniques, which are fundamental in optics and photonics, but also useful in many other engineering specialties.</font>
