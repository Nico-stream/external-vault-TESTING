<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Techniques of nonlinear optics with emphasis on fundamentals for research in optics, photonics, spectroscopy, and ultrafast science. Topics include: electro-optic modulators and devices, sum and difference frequency generation, and parametric conversion. Nonlinear propagation effects in optical fibers including self-phase modulation, pulse compression, solitons, communication, and femtosecond fiber lasers. Review of quantum mechanics, interaction of light with matter, laser gain and operation, density matrix techniques, perturbation theory, diagrammatic methods, nonlinear spectroscopies, ultrafast lasers and measurements. Discussion of research operations and funding and professional development topics. Introduces fundamental methods and techniques needed for independent research in advanced optics and photonics, but useful in many other engineering and physics disciplines.</font>
