<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers communications by progressing through signal representation, sampling, quantization, compression, modulation, coding and decoding, medium access control, and queueing and principles of protocols. By providing simplified proofs, seeks to present an integrated, systems-level view of networking and communications while laying the foundations of analysis and design. Lectures are offered online; in-class time is dedicated to recitations, exercises, and weekly group labs. Homework exercises are based on theoretical derivation and software implementation. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
