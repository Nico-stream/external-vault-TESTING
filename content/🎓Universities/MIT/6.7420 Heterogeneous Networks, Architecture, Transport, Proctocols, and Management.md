<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to modern heterogeneous networks and the provision of heterogeneous services. Architectural principles, analysis, algorithmic techniques, performance analysis, and existing designs are developed and applied to understand current problems in network design and architecture. Begins with basic principles of networking. Emphasizes development of mathematical and algorithmic tools; applies them to understanding network layer design from the performance and scalability viewpoint. Concludes with network management and control, including the architecture and performance analysis of interconnected heterogeneous networks. Provides background and insight to understand current network literature and to perform research on networks with the aid of network design projects.</font>
