<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces the fundamental and practical aspects of optical network technology, architecture, design and analysis tools and techniques. The treatment of optical networks are from the architecture and system design points of view. Optical hardware technologies are introduced and characterized as fundamental network building blocks on which optical transmission systems and network architectures are based. Beyond the Physical Layer, the higher network layers (Media Access Control, Network and Transport Layers) are treated together as integral parts of network design. Performance metrics, analysis and optimization techniques are developed to help guide the creation of high performance complex optical networks.</font>
