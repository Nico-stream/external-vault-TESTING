<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces mathematical, algorithmic, and statistical tools needed to analyze geometric data and to apply geometric techniques to data analysis, with applications to fields such as computer graphics, machine learning, computer vision, medical imaging, and architecture. Potential topics include applied introduction to differential geometry, discrete notions of curvature, metric embedding, geometric PDE via the finite element method (FEM) and discrete exterior calculus (DEC),; computational spectral geometry and relationship to graph-based learning, correspondence and mapping, level set method, descriptor, shape collections, optimal transport, and vector field design.</font>
