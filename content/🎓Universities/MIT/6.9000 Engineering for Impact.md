<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Students work in large teams to engineer hardware/software systems that solve important problems in society. Topics include requirements, specifications, system design and partitioning, detailed engineering design, prototyping and implementation, test and verification, and the ethical implications of these choices. Explores case studies of existing hardware/software systems to understand implications of different system design choices. Teams design and build functional prototypes of useful systems. Grading is based on individual- and team-based elements. Enrollment may be limited due to staffing and space requirements.</font>
