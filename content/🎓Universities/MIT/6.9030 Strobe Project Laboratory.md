<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Application of electronic flash sources to measurement and photography. First half covers fundamentals of photography and electronic flashes, including experiments on application of electronic flash to photography, stroboscopy, motion analysis, and high-speed videography. Students write four extensive lab reports. In the second half, students work in small groups to select, design, and execute independent projects in measurement or photography that apply learned techniques. Project planning and execution skills are discussed and developed over the term. Students engage in extensive written and oral communication exercises. Enrollment limited.</font>
