<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides a comprehensive and intensified understanding of the relevance of the immune system beyond immunity. Focuses on how the immune system intersects with all aspects of body homeostasis/physiology or disease and how the immune system can be manipulated therapeutically. New advances in the intersection of immunology with cancer biology, neurosciences, metabolism, aging, and maternal-fetal immunology or similar explored. Presents new modern methods and techniques applicable beyond immunology. Includes critical analysis and discussion of assigned readings. Students apply principles learned in class to generate a potential research project, presented in a written form. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
