<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces students to faculty participating in the interdepartmental Microbiology graduate program through a series of three lab rotations, which provide broad exposure to microbiology research at MIT. Students select a lab for thesis research by the end of their first year. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the program and the many research programs available, students may be able to work jointly with more than one research supervisor. Limited to students in the Microbiology graduate program.</font>
