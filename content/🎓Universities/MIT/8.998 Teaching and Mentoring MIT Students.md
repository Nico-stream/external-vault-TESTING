<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Designed for first-time physics mentors and others interested in improving their knowledge and skills in teaching one-on-one and in small groups, particularly TEAL TAs and graduate student TAs. Topics include: cognition, metacognition, and the role of affect; communication skills (practice listening, questioning, and eliciting student ideas); the roles of motivation and mindset in learning; fostering belonging and self-efficacy through peer mentorship; facilitating small-group interactions to enhance peer instruction and learning; physics-specific learning strategies, such as how to teach/learn problem solving; research-based techniques for effective mentorship in STEM. Includes a one-hour class on pedagogy topics, a one-hour weekly Physics Mentoring Community of Practice meeting, and weekly assignments to read or watch material in preparation for class discussions, and written reflections before class.</font>
