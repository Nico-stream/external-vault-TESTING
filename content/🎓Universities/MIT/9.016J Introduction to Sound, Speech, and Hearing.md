<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces students to the acoustics, anatomy, physiology, and mechanics related to speech and hearing. Focuses on how humans generate and perceive speech. Topics related to speech, explored through applications and challenges involving acoustics, speech recognition, and speech disorders, include acoustic theory of speech production, basic digital speech processing, control mechanisms of speech production and basic elements of speech and voice perception. Topics related to hearing include acoustics and mechanics of the outer ear, middle ear, and cochlea, how pathologies affect their function, and methods for clinical diagnosis. Surgical treatments and medical devices such as hearing aids, bone conduction devices, and implants are also covered.</font>
