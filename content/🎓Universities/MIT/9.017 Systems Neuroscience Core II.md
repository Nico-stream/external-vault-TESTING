<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers systems and computational neuroscience topics relevant to understanding how animal brains solve a wide range of cognitive tasks. Focuses on experimental approaches in systems neuroscience (behavioral design, parametric stimulus control, recording techniques) and theory-driven analyses (dynamical systems, control theory, Bayesian theory), both at the level of behavioral and neural data. Also focuses on regional organization (cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, and cerebellum), along with traditional divisions in systems neuroscience: sensory systems, motor systems, and associative systems.</font>
