<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Considers recent advances in the field of developmental neurobiology based on primary research articles that address molecular control of neural specification, formation of neuronal connections, construction of neural systems, and the contributions of experience to shaping brain structure and function. Also considers new techniques and methodologies as applied to the field. Students critically analyze articles and prepare concise and informative presentations based on their content. Instruction and practice in written and oral communication provided. Requires class participation, practice sessions, and presentations.</font>
