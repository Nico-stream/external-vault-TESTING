<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Discusses the neurobiological mechanisms that distinguish "the Self" from external environment; the neural circuits that enable us to know that "the Self" is in pain, or feels hungry, thirsty, and tired; and the neurons and circuits that lead to the emotional and moody Self. Examines brain mechanism that encodes the body schema and the Self in space. This includes the neural computations that allow, for example, the hand to know where the mouth is. Discusses the possibility of making robots develop a sense of Self, as well as disorders and delusions of the Self. Contemporary research â€” ranging from molecules, cells, circuits, to systems in both animal models and humans â€” explored. Students in the graduate version do additional classwork or projects.</font>
