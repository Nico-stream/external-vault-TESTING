<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">New tools are being developed to improve credibility, facilitate collaboration, accelerate scientific discovery, and expedite translation of results. Students (i) identify obstacles to conducting robust cognitive and neuroscientific research, (ii) practice using current cutting-edge tools designed to overcome these obstacles by improving scientific practices and incentives, and (iii) critically evaluate these tools' potential and limitations. Example tools investigated include shared pre-registration, experimental design, data management plans, meta-data standards, repositories, FAIR code, open-source data processing pipelines, alternatives to scientific paper formats, alternative publishing agreements, citation audits, reformulated incentives for hiring and promotion, and more.</font>
