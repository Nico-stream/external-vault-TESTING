<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides instruction on the mechanistic basis of intelligence - how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines. Examines how human intelligence emerges from computations in neural circuits to reproduce similar intelligent behavior in machines. Working in teams, students complete computational projects and exercises that reinforce the theme of collaboration between (computer science + math) and (neuroscience + cognitive science). Culminates with student presentations of their projects. Instruction and practice in oral and written communication provided. Limited to 30.</font>
