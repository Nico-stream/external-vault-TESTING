<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces and provides practical engagement with core concepts in vision neuroscience. Combination of seminar and studio work fosters interdisciplinary dialogue between visual art and vision neuroscience, culminating in a gallery exhibition of students' individual, semester-long projects. Treats the processes of visual perception and the creation of visual art in parallel, making use of the fact that both are constructive. Through lectures and readings in experimental and computational vision research, explores the hierarchy of visual processing, from the moment that light strikes the retina to the internal experience of a rich visual world. In the studio, students examine how each stage of this process manifests in the experience of art, wherein the perceptual system observes itself. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
