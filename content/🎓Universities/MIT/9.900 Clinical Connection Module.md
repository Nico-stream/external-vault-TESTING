<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides students the opportunity to connect their core neuroscience training to clinical experience (pathogenesis, diagnosis, management and therapeutic clinical trials of nervous system diseases). Students attend, along with Harvard faculty, fellows, residents and medical students at Massachusetts General Hospital, clinical seminars at MGH conducted by clinical and basic science faculty of Harvard Medical School. Each clinical experience is one week in length; students have the option to attend up to four seminars in their individual week chosen from: neuroradiology, neuropathology, neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders, psychiatry, neuropsychiatric diseases and behavioral neurology, and functional neurosurgery. Seminars are followed by one-on-one discussion with instructor to connect the clinical experience with parallel course material on the neurobiology of disease.</font>
