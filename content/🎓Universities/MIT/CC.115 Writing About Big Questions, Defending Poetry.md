<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Intensive focus on the reading and writing skills used to analyze a variety of challenging texts. Coverage includes Platonic dialogues and other works of philosophy, poetic treatises (like Sidney's Defense of Poesy, or Wordsworth and Coleridge's "Preface" to Lyrical Ballads), and creative works by the same writers, as well as criticism that probes how such texts may relate to, qualify, and inform each other. Students practice various forms of argument, orally and in writing, and consider how purpose and audience may influence one's approach. Designed to prepare students for further work in the liberal arts, as well as to promote increased confidence and enjoyment in reading, writing, and analysis. Students write or revise essays throughout the term. Preference given to Concourse students.</font>
