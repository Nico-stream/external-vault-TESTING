<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores questions of justice and ethics in war by focusing on primary texts of pre-modern works of history, philosophy, literature, and Biblical interpretation. Readings from antiquity include Thucydides, Aristophanes, and Cicero.  Examination of the Biblical tradition of just war, itself informed by the classical tradition, includes readings from early and Medieval Christian and Islamic thinkers and proceeds through the early Renaissance, with the beginning of a formalized doctrine of just war theory. Readings about current ethical dilemmas of war are discussed throughout and are given sustained attention at the end of the term. Preference to Concourse students.</font>
