<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Examines the current state and future projections of climate change and its effects on human, ecosystem, and planetary health, and develops solutions for these challenges. Class is project-based, student-focused, experiential, and transdisciplinary. Emphasizes nature- and community-based solutions, both local and global, with a focus on environmental and climate justice. Participation and teamwork are fundamental, as are experiential activities such as field trips to zero-carbon buildings and to sites undergoing rapid transformation. Working individually or in teams, students develop a term project on a climate change or planetary health solution of their choice, applying knowledge and skills to craft innovative, sustainable real-world solutions. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
