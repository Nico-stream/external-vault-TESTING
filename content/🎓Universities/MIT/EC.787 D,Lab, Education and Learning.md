<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides an overview of pedagogical theories and core teaching skills that allow students to craft their own K-12 curriculum using the design process.Â Working in groups and collaborating with an international partner, students use the design process to create a final project for a specific audience that emphasizes hands-on, inclusive, project-based learning. Suitable for students with varying levels of teaching experience. Local fieldwork and K-12 classroom visits are required throughout the semester and international fieldwork may be available to students in the summer. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. Limited to 10.</font>
