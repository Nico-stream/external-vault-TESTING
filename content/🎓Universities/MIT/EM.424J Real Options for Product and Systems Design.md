<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Focuses on implementation of flexibility (real options) in the design of products, start-ups, ongoing management of operations, or policy plans. Applies the methods presented in IDS.333: recognition of uncertainty, identification of best opportunities for flexibility, and valuation of these options and their effective implementation. Students work on their own project concept, for which they develop a dynamic business plan for design, deployment, and most beneficial implementation of their system over time. Useful complement to thesis or research projects. Class is "flipped" to maximize student engagement and learning.</font>
