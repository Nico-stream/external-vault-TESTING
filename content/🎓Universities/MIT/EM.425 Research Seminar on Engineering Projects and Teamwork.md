<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Review of research on engineering as work and problem-solving by teams, including cases, professional practices, experimental results, and teamwork fundamentals. Topics include: projects structures and dependence; communication, coordination, and concurrency; exception handling, rework, and quality; awareness, attention, and engagement; and information, uncertainty, and learning. Students consider engineering teamwork phenomena which integrate technical and organizational aspects, leading to insights on performance during project shaping, ideation, planning, control, adaptation, and lessons learned. In the second half, students work as small teams to propose an experiment which explores teamwork during engineering. Proposed experiments often become basis for research and thesis activity.</font>
