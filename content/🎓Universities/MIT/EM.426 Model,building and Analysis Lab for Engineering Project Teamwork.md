<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Explores agent-based models and simulation for engineering project management. Students build and validate models of engineered systems andÂ engineering teamwork, which integrate technology and organization useful during project shaping, ideation, planning, control, adaptation, and lessons learned. Models capture phenomena discussed in EM.425 and are simulated to forecast performance such as feasible scope, human activity, interactions, cost, schedule, quality, and risks. In the first half, students build a model and agent-based simulation from scratch. In the second half, students work in small teams on either a case modeled using methods introduced in the first half or an extension of said methods to explore a particular engineering phenomenon introduced in the first half.</font>
