<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides a comprehensive overview of human pathology with emphasis on mechanisms of disease and modern diagnostic technologies. Topics include general mechanisms of disease (inflammation, infection, immune injury, transplantation, genetic disorders and neoplasia); pathology of lipids, enzymes, and molecular transporters; pathology of major organ systems; and review of diagnostic tools from surgical pathology to non-invasive techniques such as spectroscopy, imaging, and molecular markers of disease. The objectives of this subject are achieved by a set of integrated lectures and laboratories, as well as a student-driven term project leading to a formal presentation on a medical, socioeconomic, or technological issue in human pathology. Only HST students enrolled in specific degree programs may register under HST.034, graded P/D/F. Credit cannot also be received for HST.030 or HST.031.</font>
