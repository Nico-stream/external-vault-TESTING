<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Provides a foundation for understanding the relationship between molecular biology, genetics, and medicine. Starts with an introduction to molecular genetics, and quickly transitions to the genetic basis of diseases, including chromosomal, mitochondrial and epigenetic disease. Translation of clinical understanding into analysis at the level of the gene, chromosome, and molecule; the concepts and techniques of molecular biology and genomics; and the strategies and methods of genetic analysis. Includes diagnostics (prenatal and adult), cancer genetics, and the development of genetic therapies (RNA, viral, and genome editing). The clinical relevance of these areas is underscored with patient presentations. Only HST students may register under HST.160, graded P/D/F.</font>
