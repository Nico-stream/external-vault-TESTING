<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduction to the intricacies of clinical decision-making through broad exposure to how clinicians think and work in teams. Instruction provided in patient interviewing and physical examination; organizing and communicating clinical information in written and oral forms; and integrating history, physical, and laboratory data with pathophysiologic principles. Attention to the economic, ethical, and sociological issues involved in patient care. Consists of immersive clinical experiences at Massachusetts General Hospital, leveraging extensive educational resources across inpatient clinical floors, ambulatory clinics, procedural/surgical suites, diagnostic testing areas, simulation learning lab, and didactic settings, followed by a focused experience in which students develop a proposal to solve an unmet need identified during their clinical experiences. Equivalent to combination of HST.201 and HST.202. Restricted to HST MEMP students.</font>
