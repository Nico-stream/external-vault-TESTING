<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Individually designed preceptorship joins together scientific research and clinical medicine. Students devote approximately half of their time to clinical experiences, and the remaining part to scholarly work in basic or clinical science. The two might run concomitantly or in series. Follow a clinical preceptor's daily activity, including aspects of patient care, attending rounds, conferences, and seminars. Research involves formal investigation of a focused and directed issue related to selected clinical area. Final paper required. Limited to students in the GEMS Program.</font>
