<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers biophysical, biomedical, mathematical and instrumentation basics of positron emission tomography (PET), x-ray and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), optical Imaging and ultrasound. Topics include particles and photon interactions, nuclear counting statistics, gamma cameras, and computed tomography as it pertains to SPECT and PET (PET-CT, PET-MR, time-of-flight PET), MR physics and various sequences, optical and ultrasound physics foundations for imaging. Discusses clinical applications of PET and MR in molecular imaging of the brain, the heart, cancer and the role of AI in medical imaging. Includes medical demonstration lectures of SPECT, PET-CT and PET-MR imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital. Considers the ways imaging techniques are rooted in physics, engineering, and mathematics, and their respective role in anatomic and physiologic/molecular imaging.</font>
