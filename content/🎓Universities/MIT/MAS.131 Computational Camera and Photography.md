<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Covers the complete pipeline of computational cameras that attempt to digitally capture the essence of visual information by exploiting the synergistic combination of task-specific optics, illumination, sensors, and processing. Students discuss and use thermal, multi-spectral, high-speed and 3-D range-sensing cameras, as well as camera arrays. Presents opportunities in scientific and medical imaging, and mobile phone-based photography.  Also covers cameras for human computer interaction (HCI) and sensors that mimic animal eyes. Intended for students with interest in algorithmic and technical aspects of imaging and photography. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments.</font>
