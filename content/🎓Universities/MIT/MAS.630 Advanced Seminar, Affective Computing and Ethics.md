<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Instructs students on how to develop artificial intelligence technologies that help people measure and communicate emotion, that respectfully read and that intelligently respond to emotion, and that have internal mechanisms inspired by the useful roles emotions play in humans.  Students will also discuss ethical questions that arise with the use of emotion-AI technologies and how to prevent misuse.  Topics vary from year to year, and may include the interaction of emotion with cognition and perception; the communication of human emotion via face, voice, physiology, and behavior; construction of computers, agents, and robots having skills of emotional intelligence; the role of emotion in decision-making and learning; and ethical uses of affective technologies for education, autism, health, and market research applications. Weekly reading, discussion, and a term project required. Enrollment limited.</font>
