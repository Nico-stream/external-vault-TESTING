<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Traces development of warfare from dawn of recorded history to present, focusing on the impact of major military theorists, strategists, tacticians, and technological developments. Seeks to understand the relationships between military training, weaponry, strategies and tactics, and the societies and cultures that produce and then are defended by those military structures. By examining the association between a society and its military, students acquire basic sense of strategy, develop an understanding of military alternatives, and see the impact of historical precedents on military thoughts and actions.</font>
