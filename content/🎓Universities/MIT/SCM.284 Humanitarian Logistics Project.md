<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Students completing SCM.283 may enroll for an independent study project, to be completed individually or in a small group, during the second half of the semester. Projects aim to drive innovation and improvement in humanitarian action, utilizing data and information directly from sources such as the UN, Red Cross, national government agencies, NGOs, and/or the private sector. Most projects include direct engagement with leaders from the humanitarian organizations.</font>
