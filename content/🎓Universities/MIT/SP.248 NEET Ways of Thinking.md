<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Gives first-year students an opportunity to explore the New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET) program while practicing valuable non-technical skills. Introduces students to the NEET Ways of Thinking, which are cognitive approaches for tackling complex challenges, valued by industry for thriving in an uncertain and rapidly changing world. Student teams engage in challenge-based learning in interdisciplinary engineering education via the NEET program threads. Teams learn how to apply various Ways of Thinking to solve these challenges, including practical methods and tools which they can later use at MIT and beyond.Â Subject can count toward the 6-unit discovery-focused credit limit for first-year students.</font>
