<font style="">Description:</font>
<font style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;">Introduces students to different cultures around the world via the culinary dishes they enjoy. Examines the varying histories, climates, migration patterns and religions that shape a culture. Each class, students explore and--of course!--taste one dish from one country. Work outside of class includes readings and films which reveal the cultural meanings of food. May include field trips to restaurants or neighborhoods in Boston and Cambridge. Subject can count toward the 6-unit discovery-focused credit limit for first-year students. Limited to 15.</font>
